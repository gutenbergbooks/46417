</div>

<p class='c007' >When Skippy Dare entered the big office building
he found himself in an enchanted realm. He had
never before visited one of these commercial palaces
and he gazed about him in speechless awe. He
found the revolving door so delightful that it
seemed like some freakish entertainment in an
amusement park, and he indulged himself with the
giddy sensation of going around and around in it
until a uniformed elevator starter brusquely ordered
him out.</p>

<p class='c008' >Instead, he went in.</p>

<p class='c008' >Observing the rather ornate cigar and candy
booth, he invested in a gooey chocolate bar which he
ate while studying the alphabetical list of offices.
He was deeply impressed with this imposing directory
and experienced a thrill of triumph when at
last his searching eyes discovered the name, <span class='small'>INTERNATIONAL
DETECTIVE AGENCY</span>—7-721-728.</p>

<p class='c008' >He was now on the trail, he told himself, though,
to be sure, the least false move might prove fatal
(a phrase which he had read in a detective story)
for the eye of the starter was still upon him and
he did not look the more kindly on Skippy because
of the liquefied chocolate which now decorated the
border of the boy’s mouth. His spirit mounted
when he had attained the safety of a gorgeous
elevator where every thrill of its dizzy ascent
brought him nearer to the famous detective agency’s
offices.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy, you must know, longed to be a great
sleuth. He had lately read in a newspaper of the
rounding up of a gang of counterfeiters by the
famous Carlton Conne, head of the International
office. That was the spark which brought about
the certainty that apprehending criminals was the
career which a kindly fate would offer him.</p>

<p class='c008' >It must be understood that there was some color
of reason to this bizarre choice of a vocation. He
had grown up on the waterfront among characters
sufficiently dubious. Few detectives, however great
their prowess and renown, had come into so much
personal contact with the lawless element of the
river front as had Skippy. A motherless urchin
since infancy and lacking paternal care for a period
in which his father had been unjustly jailed, his
forced association with this motley crew had given
him a remarkable insight about people in general.</p>

<p class='c008' >That Skippy’s father was at last liberated and his
good name restored is not a part of this narrative.
Suffice it to say, that the hapless man did not long
survive after his liberation. He left his young and
lonely son to the tender mercies of an aunt who lived
on the east side of the great city. And, though
Skippy was destined to have many narrow escapes
in the course of his spectacular career, perhaps the
narrowest of all was his escape from being put in
an orphan asylum.</p>

<p class='c008' >Like many great men he was denied the benefit
of an early education. Mrs. Kinney, weak in
finances but strong in resolve, triumphed over the
Board of Education, and Skippy was given working
papers which conferred on him the inestimable
privilege of earning his living.</p>

<p class='c008' >So we find him stepping out of the elevator on the
seventh floor of the mammoth office building whistling
blithely, yet distinctly conscious of the long
trousers (his first) which were such an integral part
of the new six dollar suit he was wearing. His
aunt had parted with this enormous sum only
because of the inauguration of his business career.</p>

<p class='c008' >On the door of room 721 was the magic word
<span class='sc'>ENTER</span> and Skippy paused with his hand on the
knob, giving himself a delicious moment before
making the grand plunge. It may be that he fully
expected to see a handcuffed burglar or two when
he opened the door. But no such thrilling sight
awaited him. There was nothing more startling
than a richly furnished waiting room at the end
of which sat a pretty young lady.</p>

<p class='c008' >She peered over her gleaming mahogany typewriter
desk and paused in her typing with an air of
bored expectancy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I gotta—eh, I wanta ... see ... Mr. Carlton
Conne,” Skippy stammered.</p>

<p class='c008' >She extended her hand as if by force of habit and
said wearily, “You have a letter to deliver?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nope. I—I wanta see Mr. Conne.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, you can’t see Mr. Conne. He’s a very
busy man. What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wanta job.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We don’t need any boys now.” The young lady
yawned discreetly. “If you want to leave your
name and address we’ll send for you if an opening
occurs. Did someone send you here?” she asked,
handing him a slip of paper and a pencil.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nope. I bin wantin’ to work for Mr. Conne
since I first read about him in the papers. I wanta
learn from him how to be a regular detective like
him. That’s the kinda job I want.”</p>

<p class='c008' >At this naïve confession the girl laughed while
Skippy, embarrassed, but still persistent, stood waiting.
“So lemme see him?” he urged.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, certainly not,” the girl answered a little
tersely. “I told you that Mr. Conne is a very busy
man and he’s a very important man—if you know
what that means. He doesn’t see boys. If we
should need an office boy, we can send for you,” she
added with an air of finality.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a crucial moment to Skippy. He gave a
furtive look toward a closed door, beyond which,
in some holy of holies, he imagined the great Carlton
Conne to be seated. He visualized that shrewd
mouth and those keen eyes which he had seen
pictured in the newspapers at the astonishing climax
of the famous Hawley murder case. But there was
no hope. Skippy Dare was baffled by a mere girl
at the very threshold of the lion’s den.</p>

<p class='c008' >Suddenly the door opened and a trim looking
young man emerged. It was not the great Carlton
Conne. Very casually, it seemed, he closed the
door and leaned against it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He one of ’em?” he asked briskly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, no,” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, I wish you’d get in touch up there with
the principal, or one of the teachers or somebody,
and see if they can’t round up two or three of the
kids who were run down. They ought to be able
to identify one or two of the gang in that stolen car.
According to the wop that keeps the banana stand,
there were a bunch of ’em coming out of school
when the car ploughed through. There must be at
least two who could make some identification. The
chief wants to get at least two of ’em down as soon
as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll see what I can do, but if the two who
were run down were the only ones that could
identify....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, you know the chief; he wants what he
wants when he wants it. Even if their necks were
broken he’d expect ’em to remember whether or
not they saw a machine gun in that car. So that’s
that.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The girl seemed listlessly tolerant. “I’ll get in
touch with them as soon as I come back from lunch.
Will that do?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The young man nodded and the door closed
behind him. Skippy too departed, thoughtfully,
hopefully, and with machine guns booming in his
active brain. <i>Gangsters, a stolen car!</i> The International
was on the trail of something.</p>

<p class='c008' >The question uppermost in his mind was—how
long a time would the typist remain out at lunch?
He hurried down the hall, then darted into the
shadow of a stairway from which vantage point he
could keep his bright eyes on the International
Agency’s door.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was no doubt of it now—Skippy too was
on the trail of something.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c009'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />CRASHING IN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >It was only a matter of seconds when the door
of the International offices opened and the pretty
typist stepped into the hall. Her high heels clicked
briskly along the tiled floor and she looked neither
to the right nor left, but hurried straight to the
elevators.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy, meanwhile, had backed down farther into
the shadow and was standing on the landing, his
slim body almost rigid against the cool wall. There
was a moment’s silence in which he stood tense,
listening, until at last the metallic clang of the elevator
door opening and closing echoed down to him.</p>

<p class='c008' >He relaxed immediately and his face crinkled in
a smile. With a weather eye on the landing above
and the landing below he hastily removed his coat
and tore from his new white shirt a goodly strip of
the muslin. This had the effect of setting his collar
and tie somewhat awry but he hadn’t time to worry
over that detail. He was too busy improvising a
presentable sling in which to rest his left arm. He
had a momentary impulse to bandage his head also,
but he was too true an artist to overdo the thing.</p>

<p class='c008' >Be that as it may, luck was with him, for a
moment later, when he presented himself at the International
offices, he found a small group of men,
presumably detectives, talking earnestly in the reception
room. One glance at Skippy and two of the
men hurried forward to open the door just beyond.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here y’are, kid—this way,” said one, smilingly.
“You’ll see a door to your right marked <i>Carlton
Conne—Private</i>—that’s where you’re to go. Mr.
Conne wants to see some of you kids.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy grinned amiably.</p>

<p class='c008' >He was not afraid, as he trudged manfully into
the holy of holies to confront the famous head of
the world-renowned detective agency, whose picture
he had so many times seen in the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c008' >The great detective was not an awe-inspiring
spectacle. He sat in his shirt sleeves, his chair
tilted back and his feet resting on the desk. He
was a stocky, middle-aged man with a bristly moustache
and a crisp, aggressive look. Also he was
smoking a long black cigar (Skippy soon learned
that this was a fixed habit with the man) which he
dexterously moved from one end of his mouth to
the other as he talked. When he listened, he had
a way of tilting it at an upright angle which gave
him a very shrewd and sophisticated air. It was
this attitude that captivated Skippy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well,” he said in his gruff, yet kindly manner,
“you’re one of the kids that got in the way of that
stolen car, eh? Your arm’s busted, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No sir,” Skippy answered promptly with unabashed
frankness. “My name’s Skippy Dare an’
I just wanted to get in here—kind of—so—so I
could talk to you. But....”</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne brought his feet down from the
desk and stared. “But the sling—what’s it for?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That typewriter girl,” said Skippy rapidly, “she
said I couldn’t see you about a job—that you didn’t
need nobody.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You mean you talked to Miss Purdy, our reception
clerk?” asked the detective with an enigmatic
scowl.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, I guess that’s who it was. She was in
that first room out there with the big soft rug an’
she was pretty all right, but she was cranky an’
wouldn’t lissen. I tried to tell her I wanted a job
right away an’ be a detective an’....”</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne lifted his feet from the floor and
set them back again on the desk. He shifted the
cigar about in his mouth three or four times, then
interposed: “So you got in here under false pretenses,
eh?” Before Skippy could answer, he
added, “What put the sling idea into your head?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“While I was talkin’ to the—to Miss Purdy, a
feller come out an’ said about the stolen car an’
all an’ how you wanted the kids that was run down
so’s you could talk to ’em. So right away I thought
about the sling an’ I sneaked into the hall an’ hid
on the stairway till she goes out for lunch. Then I
fixed the sling from the taila my shirt.... I’ll be
good at disguises, Mr. Conne—that’s why I know
I’d be a good detective.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, you do, eh?” A mirthful gleam lighted the
detective’s eyes, but his face was wrinkled into a
scowl. “I suppose your other disguise today consists
of working papers, eh? You can’t be more
than fourteen.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, how’d you guess!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne looked at the boy sharply.
“S’pose you’ve been blowing in all your spending
money on cheap detective magazines and going to
these rotten mystery thrillers, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nope, I don’t like them magazines, Mr. Conne.
An’ I don’t like mystery thrillers ’cause I ain’t so
dumb that I don’t know those things couldn’t
happen in real life. Gee, I can only go to the movies
once in a while an’ when I go I like to see somepin’
that makes me laugh. Since my father died I don’t
get no spendin’ money ’cause my aunt’s terrible poor
an’ she says I gotta be glad she can even lemme
sleep an’ eat.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And she had to put you out to work?” Carlton
Conne tilted his cigar thoughtfully. “And you
decided you wanted to be a detective. Why?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I always wanted to be a detective,” Skippy answered
unabashed, “ever since they railroaded my
father. When they let him out I wanted to be one
more’n ever an’ when he died an’ I come back to
lookin’ for my aunt I almost was sent to Reform
’cause I got hungry an’ went into a restaurant an’
ate a whole lot more’n I had the money to pay for.
So anyway they found my aunt an’ she took me from
the station house an’ promised to take care of me.
But all the time since, I been thinkin’ how if I was a
detective I’d know the difference between a kid that
was bad and a kid that was hungry. Gee, I know
crooks like anything, Mr. Conne, so that’s another
reason I’d make a good detective. A bunch of ’em
lived ’round me when I was on the barge waitin’ for
my father to get outa jail. River pirates an’ all!
They’re my special—my specialty!” he bragged.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And ‘Reform’s’ your special fear, eh?” Carlton
Conne asked, blinking his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, I was scareda that like anythin’,” Skippy
admitted with a shudder at the memory. “When
my father was on trial I shivered in my boots afraid
they’d send me there.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne brought his feet down onto the
softly carpeted floor and pulling up his chair, scrutinized
a letter that lay open on his desk. After a
moment’s silence he glanced up at the boy and
swiftly surveyed him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Suppose I were to tell you that I want you to
go to Reform School!” he said enigmatically.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Huh?” Skippy asked, wide-eyed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sit down!” Carlton Conne said briskly. “I
want to talk to you!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy did as he was told.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />A BARGAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Carlton Conne took the letter in his hand and
manoeuvered the cigar back and forth in his mouth.
At length he said, “Don’t be scared, kid. I want
you to go, but not for anything <i>you’ve</i> done—it’s
for me!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy gasped. “Gee, you mean you’re gonna
lemme be a detec——”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Listen, kid,” the man interposed kindly, “get
that detective idea out of your head until you’re—well
say, twenty-four years old anyhow. You have
to learn, kid, and it takes long, hard years—it’s just
another kind of school. But right now I can use
a kid like you—you can be of some use to me. If
you do your work right—keep your eyes open, your
mouth shut and remember everything, I might consider
you for the job as office boy at fifteen dollars
a week. In the mean time, I’m to have you sent
to the Delafield Reformatory where you’re going
to play the part you almost had in real life—a boy
unjustly sent there and a boy who’d make a break
for freedom at the first opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then—then you ain’t gonna send me for real!”
Skippy stammered joyfully. “I’m just sorta gonna
play de—<i>detective</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’re going to help <i>me</i>!” answered Conne with
the hint of a smile on his face. “You’re going to
play the part of a reform school kid as I told you
before. And I’m counting on you to play it with
the same kind of energy that made you sling up your
arm so that you could get in here to see me. That’s
why I’m going to trust you to do this thing for me!
You’ve got ingenuity—know what that means,
kid?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” Skippy smiled, “it means havin’ swell
ideas that go through.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“In a measure, yes. Anyway, you’ve the idea
and you have ingenuity, whether or not you know
what it means. But the question is, can I count on
you not to let anyone know (except those whom I
authorize to keep in touch with you) who you are,
nor the part you’re playing? You may have to play
it a month, perhaps longer—I can’t tell you how
long, kid. Think you could play it without betraying
your game by a look or a word?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, Mr. Conne—gee, is it sorta dangerous
like? I mean I can do that about keepin’ my mouth
shut an’ all—I learned that when my father got in
trouble—nobody could make me tell a thing. I
mean will it be dangerous if I <i>did</i> tell? Not that
I would—honest, Mr. Conne!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s what I thought, kid. I wouldn’t have
asked you otherwise. And as for its being dangerous,”
said Mr. Conne tipping his cigar so that the
lighted end stood dangerously near his nose, “I
wouldn’t allow you to do it if it was. Of course
there’s bound to be a minimum of danger in anything
of this kind, but we’ll prepare you for that.
If you stick and keep your mouth shut there’s nothing
to be feared. One of my men will be on hand
as soon as the conditions warrant it. If your aunt
consents, I’ll assume full responsibility for you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, my aunt don’t care so long’s I ain’t no expense
to her. I gotta terrible appetite, Mr. Conne,
an’ she says I eat her out of house an’ home an’
besides she wants back the six dollars she paid out
for my suit. She wants it to pay on insurance, she
says.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Very well, kid—she’ll have it. After I get
through telling you a little more of this job, you can
go home and get her and bring her down here to
me. I’ll talk to her and if she’s agreeable, I’ll give
her your first week’s salary. She knows your needs
better than you do, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” said Skippy amiably. “Aunt Min’ll
save for me, she says, so’s I’ll have some money in
bank when I grow up. She said if I got a job she’d
give me money for carfare an’ for a little spendin’
money.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“She can do that after you’ve done this work and
are working regularly in this office. Just now,
while you’re temporary, I’ll pay you your expenses
and give your aunt your salary. How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, whatever you say, Mr. Conne,” Skippy
answered happily. “You pay me more when it’s
sorta extra work, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s the basis on which all our men work here,
kid,” the detective grinned. “When your time is
on the company, naturally your expenses are too.
But leave that to me—I’ll see that you have enough
to eat in the way of chocolate even if you do leave
half of it on your chin.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy grinned and reached for his handkerchief.
When he had rubbed off the smear, he looked up.
“Will you tell me some more about this job?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne nodded and smoothed out the letter
on his desk. “This is a report from one of my
men who was on a case in Chicago,” he was saying.
“To let you know more fully about this job I’ll read
part of this report: ‘Ran across O’Reilly here in
Chi,’ he says, ‘and he tells me that Dean Devlin is
suspected of helping to spring a kid by the name of
Tucker from the South End Reform School here.
They picked the kid up in Wheaton and when
brought back to Chi he told, under pressure, that a
reverend-looking gentleman whose description fits
the Dean to a “T” visited the South End Reform
a little more than a month ago and propositioned
him. The kid was bent to beat it and the Dean
gave him some dough for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c008' >“‘Anyway, out of this money, Tucker was told to
bribe a guard and the Dean arranged the night of
the escape, etc. Tucker said it was soft—the Dean
was on the job in a closed car and took him to a
house in what looked to be a nice part of the city.
It was a pretty swell flat and the kid got everything
he wanted in the way of eats, but he was kept a
prisoner along with two other kids his own age who,
it seemed, were also under the Dean’s protection.
They too had crashed out of different reform
schools under the reverend-looking gentleman’s expert
supervision.</p>

<p class='c008' >“‘Now it seems that Devlin’s idea was this: each
kid was kept on at the flat till he found a job for
them in some distant city. Then he saw to it that
the kid got there. And so within a month, Tucker
saw the other kids go. Then Devlin told Tucker
that he had a job for him out in Montana, and that
very night he was going to drive him as far as Alton
where he could board a train absolutely safe from
suspicion.</p>

<p class='c008' >“‘They started after dark and Tucker said it
wasn’t long before he got drowsy. He thinks he
must have fallen asleep for the next thing he knew
he felt himself falling against something and then
he seemed to fall right out of the car and whirl
through the air. Next thing he knew he was in the
water. The car had gone down and he knew that
he’d go down too, not being able to swim. He
paddled furiously with his hands and looking up on
the bank he saw the Dean standing there looking
down. Tucker was just about to call to him when
a car drove up and Devlin got in it and was driven
away.</p>

<p class='c008' >“‘Evidently, the Dean was afraid that Tucker
hadn’t survived the accident and being himself confessedly
nervous of the police (that being the reason
for his generous interest in reform school boys) he
thought it best to get away as quickly as possible by
hailing the first car that came along.’”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, an’ what did poor Tucker do then, huh?”
Skippy asked excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne smiled. “Fortunately for him,
he had been thrown clear of the car and into shallow
water. Just when he had resigned himself to a
watery grave, he thrust his legs out and found that
his feet touched bottom. You can bet that he
didn’t lose any time in scrambling up the high embankment
to safety.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“An’ did he let that Devlin know that, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne studied the letter before him and
shook his round head. “No, he couldn’t. You see
he had only seen the street and the house itself at
night. After all, he had been imprisoned for a
month and both the street and the house looked just
like a hundred others in Chicago. Devlin had
driven him to and from the house in such a hurry
that he never had the chance to see where he had
been living. He decided to get as far away from
Chicago and the police as he could. But he was
picked up in a place called Wheaton, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Boy, what luck!” was Skippy’s sympathetic exclamation.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Seeing it from your point of view—yes. From
my point of view, it’s fortunate that Tucker lost out,
for it has warmed up a trail that’s been cold too long.
Devlin has been under cover a couple of years now.
O’Reilly, who is an inspector on the Chicago force,
said they’re anxious to find out where the other two
kids are that the Dean helped to crash out of reform
schools. Well, Dick Hallam knows that I’ll
be interested to know why, for I got some old scores
to settle with the Dean and like a good detective he
got the Dean’s scent and has trailed him to New
York. This morning he learned that our reverend-looking
friend has applied for a permit to visit the
Delafield Reform School next Friday. That’s the
reason, kid, that I want you to be there when he
shows up.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hot dog, Mr. Conne! I been dumb not to see
what you meant before. Gee whiz, you want me
there to trap him like, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I want you to be there to help me to prepare
the trap, kid. None of my men can palm themselves
off as kids and it seems that Devlin has been
playing up to kids only. That’s why you’re going
to Delafield. You’re going to help me find out why
he’s been acting so generous when I know that he
isn’t the type of man to do anything like that without
there being money in it somewhere. Dean
Devlin never did anything for nothing. And so
you’re going to put yourself in his way when he
makes that visit on Friday—I’ll see to it that you
have every opportunity. What’s more, you’re going
to fall in with any plans he may make for you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Boy, it sounds terrible excitin’, Mr. Conne!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not dangerously so,” the detective assured him.
“One of our men, Dorcas is his name, will either
go up with you or be up there on Friday and so be
on hand if you need him. You’ll have no cause to
worry—you won’t be alone at any time if you do
just as you’re told. But there won’t be any real
danger, kid—I wouldn’t let you into this if there
was. Dean Devlin is a notorious swindler and
blackmailer and though he can cause plenty of excitement
when he’s on the trail, I’ve never heard
of him laying a hand on anybody. He’s after
money, not people.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee whiz,” Skippy said stoutly, “I wouldn’t be
afraid anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s why I’ve taken an interest in you, kid.
All you want is nerve—courage enough to go
through with your part, and keep your mind and
eyes on all that Dean Devlin does and says. You’ve
got a job and I might as well warn you that how
well you do it will determine your permanent employment
by this company. In other words, it’s to
be your entrance exam, so you better try to pass it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, will I pass it!” Skippy cried exultantly.
“You’ll see how I’m gonna pass it, Mr. Conne!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s the talk, kid,” the detective said with a
half-smile. “And when Dean Devlin is where he
can’t take any more money from my clients or anybody
else, I’ll talk to you about staying on for a
regular job.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />JOHN DOE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >In the Juvenile Court next day, Skippy was duly
arraigned and sentenced. An International Detective
Agency man posing as an irate merchant
pressed a charge of petty larceny against John Doe,
orphan, no home and a native of the city of New
York. The evening papers carried a small first
page story on this original John Doe who was about
to spend his first night of a four year sentence in
the Delafield Reformatory.</p>

<p class='c008' >Meanwhile, Skippy was aware that his role of
John Doe, thief, had become almost too realistic
to be comfortable. His morning wait in the courtroom
had seemed interminable. The heat was oppressive,
the court procedure tiresome and he felt
not a little regret that he had not urged Mr. Conne
to have his aunt come and give him the bit of
encouragement he needed to go on with his part in
the reformatory. He thought of his dead father,
of Big Joe Tully who had lost his life saving the
Airedale, Mugs, which he had given to Skippy.
And Mugs too was gone, killed by an auto.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not that he felt in the least fearful nor doubted
his ability to go through with his strange role. He
merely felt a little lonesome and wished that he
might look out over the sea of faces that crowded
the courtroom and see his Aunt Min’s among them,
smiling her encouragement. But his aunt was at
home busy with her sewing that morning, quite
content with the money that Carlton Conne had
turned over to her and satisfied that the great
detective would see that her nephew was safe and
sound.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy had to be content with the presence of
Dick Hallam, Carlton Conne’s man, notwithstanding
the fact that he was supposed to be prosecuting
him. Hallam, however, was better than no one
at all for when the occasion permitted, he flashed a
significant look at the boy.</p>

<p class='c008' >He spent the afternoon in an ante room and Dick
Hallam, blond, tall and about twenty-eight, played
“rummy” with him. Also, he had too much to eat,
including ice cream and candy and cold drinks and
at about four o’clock Carlton Conne came in.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All set, kid?” he asked with that half-smile that
Skippy was beginning to like.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>And how!</i>” the boy grinned, feeling cheerful immediately.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s been acting like it’s a picnic, boss,” Dick
Hallam interposed gaily.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Fine,” said the detective. “You want to keep
it up, kid—you’ve nothing to fear—not a thing!
Everything’s been arranged, and I don’t think you’ll
have to spend more than a night or two at Delafield.
Meanwhile, what time you <i>do</i> spend, you’ll have
someone watching close at hand so never feel you’re
alone. The warden and a few trusted guards know
of our little game, but of course you’re to speak to
no one about it unless you’re spoken to first. Now—you
remember all the signals?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes sir—everythin’!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Dick Hallam grinned. “He’s just nervous about
riding up with that rough neck gang that’s been
sentenced today, boss. Especially one tough kid
named Nickie Fallon who got seven years for trying
his hand at a hold-up and carrying a gun. Some
character, that kid.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I know,” Conne said understandingly, “that’s
the only disagreeable part of this job, kid. But I
warned you what the company would be like.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw gee, Mr. Conne, I ain’t afraida that. I
was just wonderin’ if they’d be the kind of guys
what start a fight on the way an’ if they did what
would I do, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How would you act if you were riding up with
that bunch to start a real sentence, eh? Well kid,
get yourself in the state of mind that it is real and
act accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy did just that. About six o’clock a court
attendant led him out to a closed car. Four boys
ranging from about his own age to seventeen years
sat inside and eyed him sullenly as he crowded his
slim body among them to make the fifth passenger
on the back seat. Two detectives followed and
took the chairs before them; another detective sat
ahead on the seat beside the driver.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, if it ain’t John Doe—the kid hisself!” a
hoarse voice whispered beside him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy looked up and saw a drooping mouth and
black eyes almost too bright—Nickie Fallon. Despite
an inward shudder, he nodded and smiled.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s me,” he said simply. “Got enough
room?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nah, but that’s all jake. Might’s well get used
to crowdin’.” Then, after a pause: “Say, you
John Doe, on the level?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy gave a sidelong glance at the detectives to
see if they noted this whispered conversation
between Nickie Fallon and himself. Apparently they
didn’t, and he gave the boy another smile.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Anyways, they slipped you four years, eh?
Three years less’n me.” There was another pause
after which Fallon whispered, “They ain’t keepin’
me two days if I can take it on the lam. How
about you, kid?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy nodded again, feeling rather foolish as
he did so. However, he could think of no other
course to pursue, and instinct prompted him to hold
his tongue until he was sure of himself.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ain’t the gabby kind, eh?” said the other.
“Well, that’s the kinda pal I like. Say, if they
don’t put us near each other up there, I’ll raise the
dust—see? I wanta pal like you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy stirred uneasily. Was Nickie Fallon going
to be an unlooked-for factor in this strange
play?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c009'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />A FRIENDLY FACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >The Delafield Reform School was situated not
far from the New Jersey state line. Therefore, the
route over which the boys were taken was through
a part of northeastern New Jersey, first crossing
the great bridge which bears the magic name of
George Washington.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was upon entering the vast span that Nickie
Fallon made known to Skippy his resolve. After
that he lapsed into a long silence, looking past his
new-found pal and out upon the gleaming concrete
lanes that flanked them on both sides. His too-bright
eyes seemed to roam through space and for
a moment his gaze rested on the giant cables that
stretched between sky and water like monstrous
birds poised for flight.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy had no doubt but that Nickie’s thoughts
were also on flight. The detectives, however,
seemed not to be cognizant of it, for they were
laughing and talking in low tones and apparently
easy in mind about the safety of their charges.</p>

<p class='c008' >Dusk was settling and the broad plaza on the
New Jersey side of the bridge was resplendent with
the last rays of the setting sun. Very swiftly they
left it behind and whisked down under a broad concrete
arch which brought them to a highway practically
devoid of traffic.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ain’t many people travelin’ our way,” a boy
commented on the farther side of the seat. He was
no more than sixteen, red-haired and with small
blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Dippy Donovan’s his name,” Fallon informed
Skippy immediately. “He drew a year for wreckin’
the principal’s office in school. Twict he done
the same thing so now he’s got his bit. I don’t see
doin’ a stretch for anything like that. At least I
got some dough outa what <i>I</i> done—how about
<i>you</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” Skippy murmured. And in order to
divert the conversation from himself, he asked,
“Who’s the kid next you an’ who’s the one ’long-side
him?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Greek pickpockets—Shorty an’ Biff; don’t ast
me their last names! I can’t pronounce ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy grinned and turned his head away looking
off into the dusk. He was thinking that everything
had gone fine so far and his behavior must
certainly have impressed Nickie, for that youthful
transgressor seemed to have accepted him at face
value as one of his own kind.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was during these reflections that Skippy noticed
the detective sitting up in the seat beside the driver.
He was a thin, lanky sort of man with hollow eyes
and just at that moment he was glancing at the boys.
Presently his gaze rested on Skippy and without
warning he pursed his lips significantly and a look
flashed from his eyes that the boy immediately
understood.</p>

<p class='c008' >One of Mr. Conne’s men!</p>

<p class='c008' >He turned his head away again so quickly that,
under other circumstances, Skippy might have been
inclined to consider the look as merely a figment of
his imagination. But in this instance, he knew that
he was right and that the detective had deliberately
caught his attention to assure him of his helpful
presence there as Mr. Conne’s representative.</p>

<p class='c008' >Well, it was helpful certainly, and tremendously
reassuring to Skippy. Mr. Conne had kept his
word so far and the play gave great promise of a
successful conclusion. The boy was happier now
and no longer felt alone in his new venture. He
had a staunch and dependable supporter and all was
well!</p>

<p class='c008' >The shadows were lengthening and a lone bird
winging swiftly homeward for the night, looked dark
and small against the feeble light on the distant
horizon. Talk lagged, then ceased altogether, and
when night enfolded them in one vast black shadow
no sound could be heard save the monotonous hum
of the engine and the soft swish of the tires upon
the concrete road.</p>

<p class='c008' >After a little while they turned off into a dirt
road. The powerful headlights gleamed out over
deep ruts and in places the sandy soil lay in little
mounds, causing the car to bump and flounder about
from one side of the road to the other.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Can’t slow down too much,” the driver said
to the detectives. “I’m due back at ten and it’s
after eight now.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s O. K. with us,” said one of the men sitting
in back. He nodded at the man beside the driver.
“You’re not afraid of being thrown out either, are
you, Dorcas?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“If I am I can pick myself up again,” came the
reply. The speaker turned and though it was too
dark to see very clearly, Skippy thought the man
smiled at him.</p>

<p class='c008' >So Dorcas was his name!</p>

<p class='c008' >Glad of that additional knowledge, Skippy put
from him any lingering fears. He was confident
that nothing would mar Mr. Conne’s well laid
plans. Dorcas would always be there at Delafield.</p>

<p class='c008' >They were still bumping along at a pretty fair
speed when the engine emitted peculiar sounds.
The driver made some comment but did not stop,
saying that it was probably due to the gas which
he was trying for the first time.</p>

<p class='c008' >The engine continued to “act up” as the driver
called it, but he did not lessen his speed. They
seemed to bump in and out of the ruts faster than
ever. Suddenly the car lurched forward tumbling
them all about. And, while Skippy strove frantically
to keep himself from falling entirely off the
seat, they lurched again.</p>

<p class='c008' >The driver yelled, the brakes ground and for the
fraction of a second the powerful car seemed to
whirl. Skippy felt himself whirled along with it,
his head struck something and amid the ear-splitting
shouts and screams from the boys and the men,
there came the sound of breaking glass.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was a sickening crash after that, but
Skippy did not hear it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />A SUSPICION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Skippy’s head throbbed painfully and there was
a soreness all over his slim body when he tried to
move. His ears buzzed and his eyes opened with
difficulty upon a world that was dark and confusing.
Voices, low and hoarse, seemed all about him and
he had the sensation of rapid motion that added
materially to his discomfort.</p>

<p class='c008' >It came to him gradually that he was neither lying
down nor standing up, but that he was in a half-reclining
position with his head resting on someone’s
lap. Also, he discovered that he was again in
a car and that they seemed to be speeding along in
the dark the same as before.</p>

<p class='c008' >His head was being jounced up and down sending
sharp pains through his body, and when he felt
he could no longer stand it, he stirred. A familiar,
hoarse voice spoke directly above him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Feelin’ kinda rocky, pal?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy squinted but it was too dark to discern
anything. Nevertheless, he sensed Nickie Fallon’s
bright eyes looking down at him inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You, Fallon?” he asked weakly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah. Your head’s been banged up an’ I been
holdin’ you on my lap.” Then, reassuringly:
“But you’ll be O. K., kid—don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s dark—terrible dark....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, we’re travelin’ without no lights. I’d keep
kinda quiet if I was you. It ain’t gonna be long
’fore we’ll be where you can tumble in bed an’ sleep
till your head’s better.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’ll have nice eat—eh?” came a query in a
slightly foreign accent. “Us will too, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >A man’s deep, sonorous voice from up in front
answered in the affirmative. Nickie Fallon bent
closer to Skippy’s buzzing ears and explained,
“That guy’s name’s Barker an’ the one drivin’s his
pal, Frost. They’re our pals from now on. Say,
what a break they gave us!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was deeply puzzled. He couldn’t seem
to make it out at all. “Those Greeks,” he asked
wearily, “didn’t I hear one of ’em just now?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Shorty and Biff? Sure. They’re along. Dippy
was scared an’ wouldn’t come. But I knew you
was regular so when you went out me’n Shorty
brought you ’long seein’ you wasn’t hurt bad.
Glad, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How ’e be glad when you ain’t tell ’eem!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Fallon laughed. “S’right, Biff. Here I’m
thinkin’ the kid knows all about it.” He leaned
over Skippy again: “I didn’t have no chance puttin’
you wise on the way up an’ I go an’ forget you
been out cold since we hit the ditch.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy felt a chill up and down his spine at this
reminder. “We hit somethin’—so it was a ditch,
huh? Gee! I got hurt then, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” Fallon replied laconically, “but not’s bad
as them bulls. The three hadda take it—the driver
couldn’t put up no fight. Dippy was bruised too,
but not so bad but what he could say no when we
told him he could come with us an’ beat his rap.
So Barker says not to bother ’cause there wasn’t
no time for arguin’ an’ another car might come
along.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Barker—Frost—” Skippy asked puzzled,
“they’re your friends, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Friends!</i> I’ll say so! Cheese, ain’t it a friend
that gets us away so easy as this? Lissen, kid—it
shows how friendly when I’m waitin’ in the cooler
this afternoon an’ along comes this Frost an’ he
says he gets in by sayin’ he’s my cousin comin’ to
say so-long. Then he says how he heard the long
stretch they gimme an’ that he don’t think they
gimme no break. So then he talks like a Dutch
uncle an’ says how he an’ his pal Barker can give us
a break. We don’t do nothin’ he says. Him an’
Barker’ll find out somehow what time we’re gonna
take the ride to the jug. An’ they do.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh!” Skippy groaned as the car bumped his
head painfully.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Feelin’ all right, kid?” Fallon asked sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” Skippy answered half-heartedly. “It’s
just the bumps that make my head ache.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ll soon be there,” called the sonorous voice
which Skippy recognized as Barker’s.</p>

<p class='c008' >He raised himself painfully from Fallon’s accommodating
lap and sat upright in the seat. The
Greek named Biff was sitting on his left and on the
end of the seat sat his partner Shorty. Both were
smiling at him anxiously, particularly Biff who had
a rather set mirthfulness in his round face.</p>

<p class='c008' >Fallon obligingly crowded himself into the other
corner of the back seat in order to give Skippy
plenty of room. “Anyways, you must be feelin’ a
little better wantin’ to sit up,” he said peering over
at him. Suddenly he lowered his voice and
whispered, “Say, kid, we ain’t gotta worry now ’cause
Barker an’ Frost’s gonna see us through an’ how!
Look what chances Frost took!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What?” Skippy inquired, aware that a feeling of
foreboding had taken possession of him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Chances!</i>” Fallon continued hoarsely. “Didn’t
he find out from one of them guards what time we
was leavin’ an’ didn’t he hang ’round the court
house till he sees the bulls’ car drive up!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee!” Skippy said, feeling incapable of saying
anything more.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure! So like I’m sayin’, Frost waits his time
an’ he goes an’ gets talkin’ to the driver indifferent
like. It’s the same driver of the car we come up
in—see?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was beginning to see only too well, but he
did not say so.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Anyways, the driver says after a while he better
go in an’ see if they’re set with the kids. Frost
says sure, so long. He’s dressed in overalls like a
mechanic—see? When the driver goes in the building,
Flint quick opens the hood an’ shoots some stuff
what he’s got in his pocket, in the oil. Jest enough
so’s to make it get workin’ by the time we hit the
bumpy road—see?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy stared.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, there ain’t much more. Frost strolls
’round the corner an’ he quick gets in this car with
Barker sittin’ there like he is now. It’s a cinch!
They start off ahead ’cause the driver’s already told
Frost what road he takes for Delafield. They wait
behind some trees down that bumpy road an’ when
we blow along they give us a coupla hunnerd feet
ahead an’ follow without no lights. So when the
engine goes bad on the driver an’ we hit the ditch,
it’s more’n Frost an’ Barker expect.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” Frost spoke up in a loud, raucous voice.
“We expected they’d be stalled and standin’ around
lookin’ for help so that when we cruised up soft and
easy with no lights on, it’d be a cinch to cover the
bulls and get Fallon and whoever of you kids that
wanted to scram, into our car. But so help me, it
was easier than that!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” Fallon echoed, seeming to enjoy his role
as narrator. “When Frost and Barker come along,
there we was ditched—the bulls knocked silly an’
the driver so goofy it was a cinch for Frost to stick
him up and knock him cold when he tries to keep
us from scrammin’.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Frost used a gun, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure! But he didn’t have to shoot. An’ then
that sap Donovan kid wouldn’t come when he had
that break. He said we’d be caught an’ we’d get a
worse stretch. Aw, he was just yeller! Anyways,
it was lucky that us guys didn’t get it like the bulls.
Only you was out, kid. Well, we’re on our way, so
we should worry, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Where we goin’?” Skippy asked as calmly as he
could.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost and Barker were deep in some conversation
of their own and seemed to be paying no attention
to their charges. Fallon leaned close to Skippy’s
ear and whispered, “Between you an’ me, kid, I
think it’s a hideout Barker’s got somewhere in the
country. We been ridin’ an hour now. Barker’s
boss—see? I think he’s done a coupla stretches
hisself ’cause Frost told me on the Q. T. that
Barker’s got feelin’ for kids that get a break like we
got an’ so he helps ’em crash out whenever he can.
He’s gonna keep us under cover awhile till things
quiet down an’ then he’s gonna get us out west to
some friends. I ain’t s’posed ta tell though. Frost
says Barker wants to s’prise us.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And you say Frost—Barker’s your friend too,
huh?” Skippy asked timidly. “You known ’em
long, huh Fallon?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nah,” Nickie answered readily. “I ain’t never
laid eyes on Frost till in the cooler this afternoon.”
And in a hushed voice, he added: “I ain’t had no
good look at Barker yet, ridin’ like we are without
no lights. I first hear his voice when I get in this
car—he just waited for us when he sees how things
was. We should worry when we got friends like
them?”</p>

<p class='c008' ><i>Friends!</i> Skippy put his hand to his head, hoping
for the best, but fearing the worst.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />THE HOUSE FORGOTTEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >The question pounded in his head more insistently
than the pain he was suffering. Did not this
whole unlooked-for episode of Frost and Barker
smack too much of Dean Devlin’s tactics? And
could it not be possible that Devlin might change
not only his name but his tactics also? After all,
he concluded, it was but a step from Barker to Devlin
and from the Delafield Reformatory to the
Juvenile Court. The man Devlin that Carlton
Conne had told him about was certainly clever
enough to keep a step ahead of the police every
time.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy felt more hopeless about it all as the minutes
sped by. Here they were going farther and
farther away—heaven only knew where; and,
though he was aware that due to the accident, Mr.
Conne could not but think him blameless, he felt
that in a measure he had failed. He hadn’t any
business, he told himself, to strike his head and fall
unconscious—it was his job to <i>stay</i> conscious!</p>

<p>A DINGY SQUARE ROOFED HOUSE LOOMED UP BEFORE THEM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The fact that Dorcas, a trusted and experienced
detective, had also been knocked senseless seemed
not to lessen this feeling of guilt. Skippy was
steeped in remorse because an unkind Fate had seen
fit to have Fallon carry him away from Dorcas’
side, away from the influence that was Mr. Conne’s
and which spelled safety to him.</p>

<p class='c008' >And yet, at that moment, he was not afraid, notwithstanding
the fact that he felt that Barker and
Dean Devlin might be the same person. He was
merely puzzled as to how he should get word to
Mr. Conne if it was going to be as Fallon said, that
Barker would keep them under cover for a month.</p>

<p class='c008' >He decided that he was feeling too sick to worry
about it yet. He longed only to get in a bed and
sleep and let the morrow take care of itself. And
if Barker proved to be Devlin, he could only hope
that Fortune would smile upon him and help him to
succeed despite the mischance that had cut him off
from Mr. Conne’s help and the International
offices.</p>

<p class='c008' >A long silence prevailed in the car. Shorty and
Biff were sound asleep on each other’s shoulders and
emitting soft nasal sounds. Nickie Fallon was
hunched in his corner in a half doze and up in front
Frost and Barker were deep in whispered conversation.</p>

<p class='c008' >The road was rough but Frost handled the car
expertly, driving it as if he knew the bad spots by
experience. He had only his parking lights on now
and they were speeding along with surprisingly
little sound from the engine.</p>

<p class='c008' >After a time they entered a narrow, wooded lane
and Frost seemed to pick his way more carefully.
Skippy was quick to note that the trees, in places,
interlaced and during their entire journey through
that section, one could stretch one’s arms at either
side and touch the overhanging branches. For at
least an hour, he guessed, they hadn’t passed a
house.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We come up back roads, I betcha,” Nickie Fallon
whispered suddenly as if guessing his thoughts.
“Looks like we’re miles from nowhere. This guy
Barker knows his hide-outs, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mm,” said Skippy. “Gee, we wouldn’t know
howta get back home if we wanted to, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Frost says we can’t an’ what’s more we ain’t to
try, in case we get thinkin’ we’re smarter than him
or Barker is. He says kids like us ’ud run right into
the bulls an’ that ’ud make it bad for them—see?
Him an’ Barker’d do a long stretch if we squealed
that they helped us crash. So Frost says they ain’t
takin’ no chances on lettin’ us think we can get anywheres
alone. They’re gonna treat us swell s’long
as we’re stickin’ under cover till they help us go
west. So we gotta get used to stayin’ quiet a little
while—see?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” Skippy answered, “I think so.” He
could feel Nickie Fallon looking at him curiously.
Suddenly he felt the boy move closer to him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, lissen, kid,” he whispered, “d’you feel
funny ’bout this Frost an’ Baker?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee,” said Skippy, not a little startled, “I—I
dunno.... I—whadda you mean, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Fallon’s lips almost touched Skippy’s ear.
“Listen kid,” he confided, “I ain’t been doin’ what
I done, an’ not learnin’ that guys don’t do nothin’
for love. How come, they been takin’ all this
trouble for some kids they ain’t never laid eyes on
’fore today, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Whadda you s’pose?” Skippy whispered
timidly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We ain’t tippin’ off Shorty or Biff, but between
you’n me, kid, I think these guys got some job for
us what they can’t do themselves—see? A little
job, mebbe.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an’ if they have, it’s all right, huh?”
Skippy retorted making a brave effort to measure
up as one of Nickie’s kind.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, only if it’s bigger’n we can do an’ we get
grabbed—we’re outa luck. That’d mean double
time. Aw, it ain’t no use worryin’. If they let us
put the feed bag on regular an’ give us bunks, it’s
worth doin’ ’em a favor.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy nodded but did not answer. He was too
intent on watching the number of turns that Frost
had made within the past few moments. They had
already made three off the wooded road and now
with the fourth one they were in a dense woods and
proceeding very slowly along a road little wider
than a footpath. Then suddenly they rolled into a
clearing and stopped. Frost chuckled and switched
on his headlights.</p>

<p class='c008' >A house, square-roofed and dingy, loomed up before
them. Its shingles were so devoid of paint
that it was impossible to say what color they had
originally been painted. Blistered and peeling
from long years of neglect and with its shutters
closed like so many pairs of sleeping eyes the structure
presented a picture of abject loneliness.</p>

<p class='c008' >Unkempt grass and weeds grew up to the high
stoop; there was no porch. Behind the house and
a little to the left, Skippy glimpsed a barn that was
also in disrepair. Notwithstanding this, he supposed
that Barker and Frost parked their car in it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No bulls’ll turn you kids up here,” Frost said,
as if reading their thoughts. He turned a leathern-looking
face toward Skippy, smiling out of shrewd
eyes. “This house usta be in the center of a village
till a fire burned the town out. Then the railroad
decided to run twenty-five miles away so the folks
left it flat. This bein’ the only house left they let
the woods grow up ’round it and now, after seventy-five
years, nobody knew about it, ’cept an old nit-wit
hermit that put me and Barker wise. Last year
he died so there ain’t nobody now’ll bother you kids,
much less the bulls.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Barker turned to them and in the half-light his
long, grave face and staring light eyes contrasted
strangely with the dark wisps of hair that straggled
from under his hat and down on his forehead. But
it was when he talked that Skippy was startled, for
the man’s voice was so solemn and sonorous that it
was eerie.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now boys,” he was saying, “you see how safe
you are here. Keep it in mind and don’t get the
idea that you can manage your own freedom better
than I can. For one thing, it would get Frost and
me into trouble if you were picked up and if you
weren’t, you’d get in trouble yourselves, because this
place is almost all surrounded by swamps and you
might not find your way out. When I say the coast
is clear to ship you west—all right. You’ll come
out of this house then, and not before!”</p>

<p class='c008' >There was a warning note in his voice that sent a
chill up and down Skippy’s spine. He wished his
Airedale, Mugs, had lived to be with him at a time
like this. Shorty and Biff exchanged a few words
in their native tongue and suddenly Nickie Fallon’s
hand stole over and coming in contact with Skippy’s
wrist, he grasped it tightly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />TIMMY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Even from the outside one could sense the desolation
of the house. It took little imagination to
visualize the large, sprawling rooms downstairs and
the small, stuffy rooms upstairs weighted down to
a point of suffocation by the flat tin roof. Cobwebs,
slugs, every scurrying, every crawling thing
that thrived in dampness and gloom must thrive in
such a place, Skippy thought.</p>

<p class='c008' >He was glad of Nickie Fallon’s friendly hand on
his arm as they ascended the high stoop. And he
was considerably cheered by the oily, smiling faces
of Shorty and Biff as they all followed in the wake
of the two men. He had somehow forgotten that
these three lawless boys would have been repugnant
to him under other conditions. Now he welcomed
them as old companions, and their nearness was
comforting in this chill, lonely moment.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Metal doors ’n everythin’,” Nickie whispered in
his ear. “Locks outside too, hah? What’s out is
out an’ what’s in is in!”</p>

<p class='c008' >They entered a stuffy vestibule and passed into a
long, dark hall. At the far end of it beside the
stairway was a lantern standing on a broken stool.
It gave a feeble light at best, but now it sputtered
and flickered like some dying thing and sent out
weird shadows that stole up and down the dirty
walls.</p>

<p class='c008' >Barker stood a moment as if listening. Then he
turned his grave face to Frost and said, “No sound
from upstairs. Timmy must be asleep. Go up
and get him. We’ll make some coffee and have
something to eat. When you come down put some
oil in that lantern.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy wondered who Timmy was, but soon dismissed
the thought in his joy at hearing that
they would get something to eat. Nickie, too,
brightened up at this announcement and Shorty and
Biff made no secret of their delight, but gave vent
to several nasal grunts.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost hurried back and ascended the narrow,
rickety stairway two steps at a time. Barker motioned
the boys into a room at his right where he
already had a lantern lighted.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sit down,” he said abruptly. “I’m going out to
the kitchen to make coffee.” Then, without having
really looked at them, he stepped into the hall.
There was the sound of a key turning in the door
outside and suddenly he was back again, passing
through the room and toward another door as if he
didn’t know the boys were there. When that door
had closed behind him, his footsteps could be heard
echoing over bare boards, until, after other doors
slammed, there ensued a few moments of silence.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy had taken a chair like the rest and now
he glanced around the big room. Besides the
chairs they were occupying there were two other
chairs standing, battered and forlorn, against the
shuttered and heavily barred windows. The room
boasted no other furniture and no rugs; the floor
was thick with dust.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, it’s good there ain’t no more furniture to
catch the dust, hah?” Fallon commented humorously
as he took note of their surroundings. “Say,
I wonder what’s the big idea, barrin’ windows—I
ain’t keen on bars. Makes me think we’re in Delafield
almost.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Shorty got up softly and moved his chair close to
the others. When his pudgy body was seated, he
leaned over confidentially and said, “Mebbe we
better in Delafield, eh Neecky?” He shook his
round head at his friend Biff, then nodded back at
Fallon. “Eet look what ya call phoney the way
thees Barker don’ look at us an’ how he bring us
here to thees spooky, dirty place, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just what I teenck!” Biff agreed in an undertone.
“I get dem creeps—you know? Ever’ting
eet should be fun eef Barker an’ Frost fool dem
bulls an’ take us keeds from de school—eet should
be fun eef they do it because they no want us to do
the stretch and feel dis seempathy, eh? But no—they
act like we was goin’ to funeral, yes Neecky?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, forget it!” Nicky answered. “I’ll admit I
ain’t got no yen for this joint myself. But we ain’t
where we can say we’d like a nice up-to-date apartment.
We gotta be glad we ain’t startin’ no long
stretch at Delafield. I got a hunch Frost’s kinda
slippery an’ Barker’s a queer bird all right, but
what’s that when they’re keepin’ us outa the hoosegow!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“An’ for thees, Neecky—what we do, eh?” Biff
asked, squinting his small, brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I think,” Nicky whispered, “they got a small
job for us guys to do—see? Ain’t we all done a
job or two for ourselves, hah? So we can do a job
for them if they ast us—see?” He turned to
Skippy suddenly and asked, “Ain’t that right, kid?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure!” Skippy answered, conscious of an inward
tremor as he said it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s the kind of talk I like to hear, boys!”
came a sepulchral voice from the doorway where
Barker stood watching them. He was grave and
unsmiling, and save for a certain steely glint in his
staring eyes, his face looked not unlike a cold, clay
mask.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie Fallon broke the tension with a forced,
husky laugh. “You’n Frost give us a break, Mr.
Barker,” he said nervously, “we’d be short skates if
we didn’t try an’ square it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Of course,” Barker agreed without any enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008' >A silence ensued that to Skippy was tense.
Barker continued to stand there and stare, and the
boys sat rigid in their chairs until the welcome sound
of footsteps was heard coming down the stairs and
along the hall.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost strode into the big room and in his wake
was a tall, fair-haired boy of about sixteen whose
appearance was somewhat disheveled. He had a
wild expression in his light blue eyes and at sight of
Barker a shadow crossed his face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I been most crazy barred up in that dark hole
since daylight!” he cried. “I thought you’n Frost
would never come! Honest, I’ll go nuts if I ain’t
let out soon. Over a month an’ two kids’re gone
an’ I’m still here! Barker, it’s givin’ me the creeps—honest!
It’s worse’n if I stayed in the pen up in
Al....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ve arranged for you to go tomorrow night,
Timmy,” Barker interposed hastily. And, nodding
his long head toward the new arrivals, he added:
“You’ll have these boys to keep you company till
then.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Timmy wheeled about, obviously unaware of the
boys’ presence in the room until that moment. He
drew a hand across his forehead as if dazed. Then
suddenly, in a trembling voice, he said, “More!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy felt himself trembling too.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />TRAPPED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Skippy was destined to remember that night.
Whether it was the chill gloom of the house or the
nameless dread which seemed to hang like a pall
over the wilderness hideout, he did not know. Certainly,
everything they said and did gave them a
feeling of unreality, as if they were merely moving
puppets in a play. He missed his father, as he
never had before, and that was saying much.</p>

<p class='c008' >After their peculiar meeting with Timmy Brogan
(as they afterward learned was his full name),
Barker gravely invited them to the kitchen for refreshment.
They followed Frost through two unfurnished
rooms, wading through the dirt and dark
until they emerged into a sprawling room running
the width of the house and which, like the sitting
room, was illuminated by means of a lantern dangling
from a hook in the high ceiling.</p>

<p class='c008' >A small oil stove, battered and rusty, was trying
to send up a yellow flame strong enough to boil the
coffee. Another stove, a wood-burner, stood back
in the opposite corner as if it were trying to hide its
antiquity from the boys’ eyes. A sprawling cupboard
stood in another corner and in the center of
the room, surrounded by broken down chairs and
boxes, was a dilapidated table holding several
plates of freshly-made sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sit down, boys,” Barker said simply. “The
coffee will be ready in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Seems like I ain’t fed in a million minutes!”
Timmy said with bitter complaint. “Since you left
me that lousy sandwich when you beat it at dawn,
I....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Shut up!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >Barker’s funereal voice filled the room for a tense
second, then he turned on his heel and walked
toward the cupboard in long, determined strides.
Timmy grew pale and sat down on the nearest box,
reaching hungrily for a sandwich.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost chuckled mirthlessly for no reason at all
that Skippy could see. Barker took out several
thick cups with which he strode back toward the
stove and poured the coffee when it was ready.
After that they ate, and a strange, silent repast it
was with the lantern sending eerie shadows up on
the smoke-blackened ceiling and leaving the little
group in a semi-gloom about the table.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy ate because he was hungry, but his mind
wasn’t on it. He was too confused, too worried at
the unexpected turn of events to think of anything
else but what had happened and what might happen.
Barker made him feel strangely hopeless about this
adventure which he had set out upon so light
heartedly and which Carlton Conne had seemed to
plan so thoroughly. It now appeared that he who
had planned on helping to trap Dean Devlin had
himself been trapped in a larger web.</p>

<p class='c008' >That was it—he was <i>trapped</i>!</p>

<p class='c008' >He looked at the two kitchen windows. They
were shuttered and barred like the windows in the
other rooms. The door leading out of the kitchen
opened onto a shed and Skippy was certain that
that too was invulnerable both inside and out. Upstairs,
he learned ten minutes later, were three
stuffy bedrooms fit for occupation. He was assigned
to one of them along with Nickie Fallon and
Timmy. Shorty and Biff occupied the room next
to them and across the hall was the room in which
Barker and Frost alternately slept and watched to
see that their young protégés did not triumph over
locks and other man-made obstructions and steal
forth into the night.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ever since I been here, I been askin’ myself—why
the locks, if them two guys brought me here
outa sympathy?” Timmy whispered to his new
room-mates as Frost bade them a chuckling good-night
and locked the door on the outside. He retreated
to his tumbled looking cot and held his head
in his hands wearily while he stared at the lantern
hanging above his head. “Take it from me, guys,
there’s somethin’ screwy about Barker an’ Frost,
an’ you might’s well get smarted up.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy looked at the decrepit bed in which he
and Nickie were to sleep and his heart sank. There
wasn’t a breath of air save the occasional wisps of
breeze that mysteriously found their way through
the chinks in the shutters. He walked to the window
and by stooping could look through the bars
and see a rising moon casting a flickering gleam of
light on water.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Is it a lake or somethin’?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lake, me eye!” Timmy answered. “It’s a
swamp, that’s what. You’ll see how much when
the moon comes up good. There’s only a little
back yard an’ then the swamp begins.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say,” Nickie whispered inquiringly, “you got
somepin’ on Barker an’ Frost? What’s the matter,
anyways?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Timmy got up and walked over to Fallon.
“They got me scared, that’s what! Barker’s terrible—he’s
got me scared skinny an’ I’ll tell you
guys why!” He tiptoed to the door, listened a
moment and then came back. “Did <i>he</i> help you
guys crash outa reform?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie explained that they had not got that far
before Barker had reached out a helping hand and
gathered them in. While he was speaking they all
moved toward the bed and sat down, there being
no chairs in the room.</p>

<p class='c008' >“So he kinda switched the deck with you guys
for a change, hah?” Timmy commented after Fallon
finished. “That proves what I say about him
bein’ a pretty foxy guy, turnin’ a trick that maybe
ain’t gonna be so healthy for us in the end.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How come?” Skippy asked softly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s a long story, an’ if you guys ain’t sleepy...”
Timmy began.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, lissen,” Nickie interposed, “the kid’n me
don’t mind bein’ put hip. I didn’t like the way
Barker bore down on you downstairs an’ it give me
the hunch mebbe he’s too phoney even for us—see!
So come across an’ mebbe we won’t get the short
enda the stick.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure I’ll spiel, but that’s all the good it’ll do,”
Timmy said dismally. “We’ll never get nowheres
together, take it from me—Barker ain’t lettin’ us!
He’ll take us away from here, one by one, and so
far the two guys that have gone from here ...
anyways, I’ll tell you what I think—Barker’s a
<i>killer</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>What?</i>” Skippy gulped.</p>

<p class='c008' >They heard the scraping of a lock and suddenly
the door swung open. A breeze from the hall blew
out the feeble lantern light and they were in total
darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c009'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />THE WAY OF DEVLIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Skippy felt Nickie’s hand on his arm and Timmy
crowded up close to both of them. For a second
there was no sound, then they heard someone move
in the doorway and presently Barker’s voice pierced
the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What have you been whispering about in here,
Timmy?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Whisperin’?</i>” Timmy’s voice trembled ever so
little. “Aw, I was only tellin’ these guys how you
got me outa the pen an’ they was tellin’ me how
slick you helped them—that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was certain that Barker sighed. In any
event, he said, “Hmph! You better let them go to
sleep and do your talking tomorrow!” He shut
the door as swiftly as he had opened it—the key
turned in the lock and all was silence.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie was alert, tense. He nudged Skippy and
Timmy and then he moved his lips. “Us three can
cram into bed,” he said so softly that the boys had
to strain their ears to hear. “We’ll pull a blanket
over our heads so’s we can talk—see? It’ll be hot,
but we should worry, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was worried, but he didn’t say so for he,
too, was anxious to learn from Timmy what lay behind
Barker’s grave, almost brooding exterior.
He undressed and hopped in on one side of Timmy
while Nickie crawled in on the other and if they felt
stifled as they whispered under the blanket for
three-quarters of an hour or more, they were not
aware of it, so intensely interesting was the story
to which they were listening.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Where do I come from?” Timmy repeated in
answer to Skippy’s question. “Albany. Barker
comes in the jug where I’m doin’ five years—for
stealin’. Well, he looks like a minister an’ I think
he passes it out that he is one. Anyway, he spies
me an’ gets talkin’ kinda religious an’ fatherly while
the guard’s around. When the bloke strolls off,
Barker quick drops the fatherly act an’ wants to
know would I like to crash. Sure, I tells him. He
tells me to be set the next night—that he’ll be waitin’.
When he leaves he slips me fifty bucks an’ tells
me to slip it to the guard I think’ll look the other
way for that much jack.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You made it, huh?” Skippy asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Easy. Fifty bucks is big money for them
guards. The one I stake lets me slip without no
trouble at all. Barker was waitin’ outside in a big
closed car.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Frost with him?” Skippy asked curiously.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nope. I never seen that grinnin’ skunk till
Barker brings me down to this hole. That’s a
month an’ a half ago. Barker took me straight to
a house in Albany where he said he rented a room.
On the way he tells me that from then on I should
say I’m his son. So I do. We only stay in the
house three days. I’m willin’ to keep under cover
so he tells the landlady an’ everybody I ain’t feelin’
so well, that’s the reason I don’t go out. Barker
steps out plenty an’ I hear him talkin’ to the landlady
down the hall.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’d they talk about?” Skippy asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure—it was nothin’ much. A lotta boloney!
Barker makes the dame think he’s one grand old
man—all for his wild son—all that bunk. Anyways,
the last day we’re there he drags me out
right after dark. Takes me to a doctor. When I
ast him what for, he says that’s his business; that
I should act like a sulky son. Well, I do it. The
doc gimme the up an’ down an’ says O. K. So we
go back to the house an’ the landlady hands Barker
a telegram that I found out afterward was from
Frost. It says somethin’ about grandma bein’ sick;
that he should come home to New York. It was
signed Joe.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then you packed up an’ come here, I bet,”
Skippy said.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure,” Timmy murmured. “He leaves the telegram
on the bureau an’ down in the hall he gives
the landlady a coupla weeks’ rent. Tells her if we
ain’t back by then, he’ll send the dough every week
till we do get back. He give her a song and dance
bout wantin’ a farm when he come back an’ that he
wanted the room to come back to so’s he’d have a
place while he was lookin’. When we come away
he tells me it’s a lotta boloney he give her; that he
only wanted the room till this little business broke
O. K. He says he ain’t got no idea of goin’ back
there.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mm,” said Nickie, “sounds like he was buildin’
an alibi for hisself, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s what I gets thinkin’,” Timmy admitted.
“Anyways, we ride all night an’ plenty next mornin’
till we hit a woods in the mountains where
Barker parked his car way in the trees. We slep’
there all afternoon, then start ridin’ again when the
sun was goin’ down. Bout nine or so we come
here. Frost’s here. So’s two kids bout our age—Willie
Meehan, an’ Sammie Brown. Next day
we get comparin’ things—Willie comes from Boston
an’ Sammie from Syracuse. They crashed jugs
like me, with Barker’s help. What’s more they all
stayed in a city room a coupla days like me an’ just
before they leave a telegram comes tellin’ Barker
he’s gotta hustle to New York on business or that
old stuff bout his dying grandmother. Anyways
it’s Frost that always sends ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“An’ those kids,” Skippy asked eagerly, “did
they say they were Barker’s sons an’ go to a doctor
like you?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure. It’s the same old line—he’ll do the same
with you guys too. Blamed if I know his racket,
but when I’m here about a week, Willie says
Barker’s sendin’ him west that night. Willie’s here
a little over a month then. Seems he don’t keep
kids much longer’n that—I’m overdue now!” He
laughed grimly. “Anyways, he beats it with Willie
an’ we was glad he was gettin’ a break an’ on his
way. So two days after Barker comes back—it’s
at night like he always comes an’ goes an’ Sammy
an’ me’s sleepin’ in this room. Frost and Barker
think we’re dead’s doornails so when they come upstairs
they get arguin’ an’ forget how loud they
talk. Well, I’m awake and how! I hear the
whole works.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Gee!</i>” Skippy breathed, happy in the thought
that now perhaps he would learn something of
value to Mr. Conne, when he should be so fortunate
as to see the detective again.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, I said a lotta things like that when I was
listening,” Timmy confided. “I heard Barker say
somethin’ about that Willie wouldn’t go through.
So Frost asks him what he did then. Barker says
he had to do the job hisself. Frost laughs when
he hears that. He tells Devlin he better plan his
jobs better if he don’t wanta take the hot squat.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Devlin?</i>” Skippy asked breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, I forgot to tell—Barker’s an alias.
Devlin’s his right moniker. I found it out when I
was here two days.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“So Frost told him he might burn?” Nickie
asked, as if he was turning this odd warning over in
his mind. “And that’s what makes you think
Barker’s a killer—’cause Frost cracked that?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah—sure. What else? Sammy promised he’d
try an’ get word back to me somehow so’s to lemme
know what job Barker wanted him to do, but he
knew an’ I knew it couldn’t be done. Barker’d
most likely send him too far away afterward. He
went a coupla weeks ago. I been alone since, wonderin’
an’ worryin’ when my turn’d come an’ what
it’d be!” Timmy took a deep breath and almost
sobbed. “If it’s a killin’ job—I ain’t goin’ through.
I ain’t gonna pull no trigger on nobody for Barker
or nobody else!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Me, neither!” Nickie asserted flatly. “Looks
like Barker springs us ’cause it’s easier than springin’
older guys in the big house. Then he gets us
for a job an’ if anybody’s grabbed it’ll be us ’cause
the law figures us future criminals anyway—see?
Ten to one he dopes it we won’t squeal ’cause he’s
did us a favor.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just what <i>I</i> think!” Timmy agreed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not having the lawless squint upon such matters,
Skippy did not know what to think. His
active mind was full of plausible answers to the
problem, yet somehow he could find no convincing
explanation as to Devlin’s real motive. Why did
the man, in each case, hire a room and have the boy
pose as his son? Why was each boy required to
go with him to a physician? There seemed no answer
to those questions. Particularly was he puzzled
as to why Devlin should accord them all this
prisoner-like treatment while they were awaiting
release.</p>

<p class='c008' >He got nowhere along this line. He always
ended by asking himself the question: was Devlin
as grim of soul as he was of features? Some inner
voice was ever prompt in answering this query of
his and it was always the same.</p>

<p class='c008' >Yes!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />OVERHEARD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Sleep wouldn’t come to Skippy that night.
Hours after Timmy had dejectedly gone to his cot
and Nickie had sunk into deep, untroubled slumber
beside him, he lay on the hot bed worried and
lonely. Aunt Min and Carlton Conne seemed
separated from him by a dark and terrible abyss,
and he shivered with the fear that he might not get
back again to the people and places that typified
law, order and safety. Particularly safety.</p>

<p class='c008' >He hadn’t any illusions now. Clearly, nothing
but a miracle would get him out of the web which
had so entangled him the moment he had been
placed in Dean Devlin’s car. Nothing save an
almost impossible combination of favorable circumstances
would make it possible for him to get word
to Mr. Conne. And how, if it were true that
Devlin kept them imprisoned until he saw fit to embark
them on the dark, mysterious “job,” could
those circumstances occur so that he might be of any
real help to Carlton Conne? He despaired of any
such good fortune.</p>

<p class='c008' >The breeze was not strong enough to penetrate
through the shuttered window now. Nothing but
damp, humid heat found its way to his burning
cheeks. He felt the stillness about the air augured
a heavy storm and soon he heard thunder in the distance.</p>

<p class='c008' >The buzz of crickets, the tin-like sound of locusts
vied with the deep throated chorus of frogs about
the house. Once an owl lent its eerie hoot to this
droning night symphony and, as if in answer, another
chorus of insects filled the air with dismal
chantings.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy stood it as long as he could, then got up
and tiptoed to the window to get a breath of air.
Through the bars he could see the quarter moon, a
shimmering bit of silver light gleaming upon the
swamp and here and there transforming it into
pools of shining, black lacquer. Overhead, however,
sullen clouds were slowly trespassing and it
would be only minutes before the lonely place would
be surrounded by darkness and storm.</p>

<p class='c008' >He clung to one of the bars and peered down
upon the roof of the woodshed just below the window.
It would be an easy jump down there, he
decided—easy, if it were not for the five long strips
of iron that so effectually barred the way. Crude
and amateurish though they looked, Skippy knew
that they had been put there to withstand any such
feeble attacks as his two bare hands might make
upon them.</p>

<p class='c008' >While he was digesting this fact he became aware
of voices, Frost’s and Devlin’s, coming from the
hall. He stepped toward the door noiselessly and
pressed his ear close against it.</p>

<p class='c008' >The men were not in the hall as he had at first
thought, they were in their room with the door
ajar. It was evident that they had intended to converse
in whispers, but presently they were launched
upon an argument and caution was forgotten.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tell me if you can,” Devlin was saying angrily,
“what I’m going to do with those two Greeks, eh?
It isn’t enough that you didn’t discover what they
were before we brought them all the way here, but
on top of it, you tell me I’ll think of what to do
about them! <i>I’ll think</i>, eh?” He sneered. “All I
can think of is that they’re Greeks and that I don’t
look anything like a Greek or talk anything like
one! How can I pass them off as my sons, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Easy, boss, easy,” Frost said placatingly, “I
didn’t know they was Greeks no more’n you. They
was sentenced before I gets into court. The ones I
counted on was that Nickie and that other kid,
Dippy and that smart-looking youngster John Doe.
You coulda knocked me cold with a feather when
Fallon tags the Greeks along. There wasn’t no
time to argue, was there?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“All right—all right,” Devlin boomed. “Just
tell me what I’m going to do with ’em! They
can’t go back and tell what they’ve seen here and
I’m not going to go to the trouble of getting them
off my hands without getting some money out of it,
that’s all there is to it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“O. K., boss. It’s soft—soft.” Frost’s voice
was rasping yet servile. “There’s black wigs a guy
can buy, ain’t there? Well, I’ll grab me one, fix
myself up like a grease ball, talk spig, take the kids
one at a time and try my hand at your racket.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now you’re talking, Frost. Take one—say, to
Pittsburgh, eh? You’ll be father and son looking
for work in the mills. And I’d only aim for the
minimum price on both of them. They’re not
worth taking any chances on big money. The other
Greek you could take—say to Maine. That’s
putting a safe distance between, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure thing, boss,” Frost crowed. “And say,
listen, why not lemme clean up the job right on the
spot, hey? No use makin’ extra trips back here. I
can work it careful.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hmp—it’s an idea, Frost. We’ll dope it out
after tomorrow night and Timmy’s off my mind.
Don’t try to do anything until then.” There was a
pause, then: “Do you think he’s wise to anything?
I sort of feel that he was doing more than just
whisper his family history to those other kids.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nah; what could he say, hey? He ain’t seen
nothin’ no more’n the others. You’re just gettin’
nervous, that’s all. But I’ll tell you what, Dean,
you <i>will</i> make them kids wise that something’s
phoney with your big heart racket, when you don’t
even trust ’em unless you got the key to their room
in your pocket. You’re puttin’ the lid flat down and
scarin’ the life out of ’em too soon. Now if I was
you, I’d let ’em loose in the house. Maybe if
you’d done that in Chi, Tucker wouldn’t got away
like he done. If he’d known where you hung out
he’d been back and you’d cashed in on him.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, I didn’t and that’s my funeral,” Devlin
said in measured tones. “I’m only glad Tucker
wasn’t caught so he could spill out my racket. I
guess he got away all right or we’d have seen some
flat-footed dick keeping our trail warm before this.
Anyway, I think you’re right about locking up the
kids. I’ll make ’em think I trust ’em even if I
don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“O. K.,” Frost chuckled, “I’ll do it right now
and give ’em a surprise in the morning. Long’s I
got the keys to the downstairs doors in my pockets,
we ain’t got no cause to worry that they’ll sneak.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy did not wait to hear more. He made a
running jump from the door to the bed and had assumed
a restful, sleeping posture before Frost’s
key scraped in the lock. But the man made no
effort to enter. Instead, he turned on his heel and
recrossed the hall to his room and presently a deep
silence pervaded the house.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not many seconds later, the storm broke and the
dark, eerie house trembled and groaned like some
stricken thing in the whistling gale.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Rain lashed against the shutters and poured
down the side of the house in torrents. Loose
shingles slammed and clattered with every twist of
the wind and the trees bowing down before its
fury moaned piteously, their branches squeaking
and crackling like ancient spectral voices in the
night.</p>

<p class='c008' >A zig-zag streak of lightning flashed upon the
dirty wall and the clap of thunder that followed
seemed to sweep away all rational thought. To
Skippy, the world had suddenly gone mad and he
did not wonder at it since Devlin, asleep no doubt,
had locked within his black heart secrets which
challenged even the warring elements.</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne had said of Devlin that he was
criminal, but not dangerously so. Perhaps that
had been true once, but not now. Devlin had contributed
something more than just law evasion to
the sordid atmosphere of the house. Human laws
defied had given the place its dark, furtive character
for one sensed it in every nook and corner
that made up the tottering structure.</p>

<p class='c008' >The storm screamed on and through the tiny,
hot room a cooling breeze now found its way.
Skippy shifted around to the foot of the bed and let
the welcome air blow over him. He wished he
might call out and hear a cheery answer from Big
Joe Tully as in the old river days. Nickie was still
undisturbed by the shrieking night and Timmy,
though restless and tossing about, was asleep.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy thought of the two Greeks, Shorty and
Biff, apparently oblivious of the meaning of it all.
Their bland, oily faces reflected pretty accurately
the stupid squint which they had on their petty
thieving practices; it was the only thing they knew,
the only means of living which they could understand.
Skippy wondered how they would feel about
the dark and seemingly sinister “job” which Devlin
or Frost would demand that they carry out as the
price for their sympathetic “protection.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Not for a moment was Skippy deceived as to
who was the brains of the Devlin-Frost combination.
Frost was a chuckling, subservient thief, but
it was in the depths of Dean Devlin’s dubious soul
that the plans were carefully laid.</p>

<p class='c008' >He was making mental note of all these things in
anticipation of the day when he should see Carlton
Conne and give his report. It made not a bit of
difference that this day now seemed remote—it had
to come sometime! He would spend all his waking
hours preparing for it despite the bars and locked
doors that mocked him.</p>

<p class='c008' >He would escape somehow—some day!</p>

<p class='c008' >The sound of scurrying rats overhead gave him a
brilliant idea. The attic! Was that barred also?
He determined to find out somehow, now that
Frost had so generously secured for them the run
of the house. Well, he would run, certainly, just
as soon as the opportunity presented itself.</p>

<p class='c008' >As he meditated he heard Timmy throw himself
from the cot and shriek. Skippy was on his feet
and helping him up in a second.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Dreaming—huh, Timmy?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Timmy was trembling violently. “It was like as
if it was true,” he said in a choking voice. “I’m
dreamin’ it’s a night like this an’ I’m out with Devlin
in a funny-lookin’ old car.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, it’s this storm what made you dream,”
Nickie interposed, aroused by the commotion and
sitting up rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >Timmy’s protest was almost a sob. “I’m tellin’
you it was real-like! We’re ridin’ along in the
dark an’ it’s lightnin’ an’ I’m gettin’ wet an’ I
shiver. All of a sudden it don’t look like Devlin
sittin’ beside me no more—it’s like a ghost without
no body—just big, starin’ eyes like Devlin’s—then
I’m wise he’s a killer—see? But he’s gonna kill
<i>me</i>!” Timmy crawled up on his cot and sat down,
still trembling. “Somehow I don’t remember what
happened after that till I feel like I’m runnin’ an’
that Devlin’s chasin’ me. Then when I feel like
I’m half dead I look up an’ see it’s this house. Up
in the attic I see you an’ Nickie at the little window.
I’m hurt an’ tell how Devlin tries to kill me. All
of a sudden long arms come reachin’ out from behind
a big tree out in front. All I see is Devlin’s
starin’ eyes an’ I’m sorta chokin’ to death when I
wake up on the floor.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Holy Smoke!” Nickie exclaimed. “What a
guy! Can’t you pick out nothin’ better to dream
about?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy sat down beside Timmy and patted him
sympathetically. Suddenly the door opened and
they saw Devlin’s tall form outlined there.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s going on here?” he asked impatiently.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Timmy,” Skippy ventured; “he’s hadda bad
dream an’ it threw him outa bed!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hmph!” the man boomed in his funereal voice.
“Dreams don’t come true! Get back to bed and to
sleep, you kids!” He shut the door and they heard
his bare feet patter across the hall.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie sneered contemptuously at the door.
“It’d be too bad for you, Devlin, if that dream did
come true!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But it won’t,” Skippy said soothingly. “My
aunt always says dreams are always opposite.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Timmy had got hold of himself somewhat, and
valiantly tried to forget his dream. “Yep,” he
agreed, “I guess that’s right. Mebbe it was the
heat an’ my stomach. I never could eat right fore
goin’ to bed without dreamin’ terrible things. But
I never dreamed nothin’ bad’s that, that’s all.”
He laughed nervously. “Aw, I’ll forget it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy wondered if he really would. Somehow
he had the feeling that he wouldn’t forget it—not
ever!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />THE EVERGREEN TREE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >The remainder of the night was a torment.
Toward dawn Skippy dozed occasionally only to
awaken each time with a start to find himself trembling
and expectant. What he might hear or see
he could not imagine, but he watched with relief the
murky light of the new day seeping in through the
chinks of the shutter and routing the dismal gloom
that kept him in breathless suspense.</p>

<p class='c008' >The light did no more than seep in, however, for
the storm left in its wake gray, sullen skies and air
that was warm and still. Frost went downstairs
about six o’clock—Skippy had already learned to
distinguish his lighter, hurried step from Devlin’s
heavy tread. Then, after a moment, he heard the
man at the barn, and soon the low hum of the car
was audible as he backed it out and around the
house.</p>

<p class='c008' >Silence reigned in the dismal place for another
hour or so and then Skippy heard Devlin moving
about in his room. When the man walked
hurriedly downstairs, Nickie awoke, wild-eyed and
staring.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Who—what’s that?</i>” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just Devlin,” Skippy answered. “What’s the
matter—you ain’t been dreamin’ like Timmy?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie ran his fingers through his straight black
hair as he sat up. “I don’t know—maybe so. I
just get scared when I hear the least little sound in
this joint. <i>Me</i>, that’s never been scared of nothin’—hah!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I know,” Skippy admitted. “I guess Devlin
makes us feel that way, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie nodded. “If I didn’t hate the jug worse’n
this house, I’d say, let’s sneak.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Maybe we’ll have to,” Skippy said softly, and
nodded toward the sleeping Timmy. “If we stick
round s’long as he’s done an’ get like he’s now, I’d
rather take a chance an’ beat it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie nodded thoughtfully. “Anythin’ you say,
kid, an’ I’m stringin’ along. Even if you’re only a
kid, that bean of yours works all day.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy warmed to Nickie for that tribute and he
felt less afraid. It gave him a sense of strength to
know that he had such an ally for he realized that
he could do little alone.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin called them gruffly to breakfast and the
food wasn’t bad. It would have been almost
pleasant, Skippy ventured to remark, if they only
had more light in the kitchen. Nickie agreed to
this, but Timmy seemed in a daze.</p>

<p class='c008' >After breakfast, Devlin made a concession which
took them by surprise. “On account of the weather
being so hot,” he said gravely, “I’m going to let
you boys stay outside a while.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee!” Skippy murmured.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin scowled. “It’s taking a chance to let you
out, but I’m counting on you not straying away from
in sight of this house—<i>understand</i>?” After a
pause, he added: “I got my reasons.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They understood only too well and made no
further comment when Devlin unlocked the front
door and sat on the ugly high stoop as they passed
down and into the clearing about the house. Timmy
sat on the bottom step, blinking his blue eyes and
clasping and unclasping his hands.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s the matter?” Skippy asked sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c008' >Timmy grinned. “I been in that dark house so
long, my eyes don’t know howta act, that’s all.”
He took a long, deep breath of the murky air as if
it were the utmost luxury. Then suddenly his thin,
pale face became almost colorless and he nodded
toward the right of the clearing. “Look!” he
gasped.</p>

<p class='c008' >The other boys turned and saw a huge evergreen
tree spreading its branches over the sinister house.
Not a breath of air rustled its broad boughs—it
seemed to stand there waiting.</p>

<p class='c008' >“The tree in my dream!” Timmy said, trembling.
“I never seen it till now! When I come
here it’s night an’ I don’t notice it. I never looked
out front—just now it’s the first....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s he talking about?” Devlin said, annoyed,
from the top of the stoop.</p>

<p class='c008' >“About that tree!” Nickie said, with ill-concealed
contempt. “He had a terrible dream bout it last
night—see?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin bit his lip and frowned. “It’s nonsense!
What’s wrong with you, Timmy, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What wouldn’t be wrong, hah?” Nickie retorted
sullenly. “If he’d stayed in the pen he
wouldn’t got no worse treatment than you give him—shuttin’
him up a month in this hole till he’s all
shot. I ain’t sayin’ that it ain’t better late than
never, but even up in Delafield they don’t keep a
guy shut away from the daylight. Timmy or none
of us <i>asked</i> you to spring us so you might give us a
break an’ treat us like human bein’s.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin’s lips were set and grim and his beetle
brows were so drawn that they made a deep furrow
above his large nose. “Listen, you,” he said
angrily, “any more talk like that from you and
you’ll regret it. I’m running this and whether you
did or didn’t ask to be sprung, makes no difference.
You’ll keep your mouth shut—<i>understand</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >The Greeks, smiling and silent until then, emitted
a sound of dismay. Nickie mumbled something
under his breath but made no other answer for the
warning note in Devlin’s voice was not to be misunderstood.
Skippy gulped, and just then they
heard the unmistakable sound of an old car chugging
along through the narrow swamp trail.</p>

<p class='c008' >Presently Frost appeared in the clearing, driving
an ancient, dilapidated car that groaned and
ground to a stop. The sight of it was amusing and
the boys stared at it, smiling and curious. Timmy,
however, did not share this curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008' >He had taken one look at the car, and fainted.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />TALK AMONG FRIENDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >The day dragged by and though Timmy seemed
to have recovered from the effects of his spell, he
moped around, melancholy and wrapped in his own
gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s goin’ nuts, that’s what he is,” Nickie whispered
to Skippy after the evening meal was over.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s why we ain’t stayin’ to get like him,”
Skippy whispered back.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie winked and nodded. He was beginning
to see Skippy’s point of view more and more.</p>

<p class='c008' >They had cleared away the dishes and sat down
to a game of cards at Shorty’s suggestion, which
was received with enthusiasm, and even Timmy had
brightened and apparently put out of his mind the
fears that had so unnerved him during the day.</p>

<p class='c008' >Just before dusk, Devlin and Frost went out and
locked the back door behind them. The boys
hurried to the two back windows and peered out
through the chinks in the shutters to watch the men
go to the barn and presently back out in the queer
looking car.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wonder where they’re goin’?” Skippy asked of
no one in particular.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, they’ll be back,” said Timmy grimly. “For
<i>me</i>!” He lunged back to the table and took up his
hand of cards with grim determination.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Atta boy!” Skippy said. “Gee, Timmy, don’t
get down again, huh? Devlin can’t <i>make</i> you do
nothin’ you don’t wanta. You’ll soon find out
what he’s gonna tell you to do. Beat it after that;
soon’s you get the chance.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, some chance it’ll be takin’, I bet!” Timmy
exclaimed. “I got a hunch an’ that’s all there’s to
it. But I ain’t lettin’ myself go off the handle no
more—I wanta keep what nerve I got to tell Devlin
where he’s gettin’ off if he springs any killin’ jobs
on <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That goes double,” Nickie said, suddenly very
serious. “I don’t like the look in Devlin’s eye, he
looks crazy b’lieve <i>me</i>, an’ Timmy’s right bout
needin’ all his nerve. He’ll need it—we’ll all need
it when the time comes. An’ lissen, guys, maybe
we’ll wanta know how we make out afterwards,
hah? What d’ye say we dope out where we’ll
write letters to, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Shorty laughed. “Eet is funny, Neeckie. You
talk lak that when mebbe we all see each other again
some place out west together, eh? Ees that not
what you thought when we come here, yes?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah—I thought a lotta things when I come
here,” Nickie answered. “That’s why I come.
But I ain’t so sure about Devlin sendin’ us somewheres
out west where we’ll meet—see! He ain’t
said nothin’, so I guess it means we say so long
when we blow here. Anyways, we land some
place; there ain’t no sayin’ there won’t be somewheres
we’ll go, so I say let’s write an’ tell each
other how we shook Devlin or how we didn’t. Now
I got a aunt where you guys can write me in New
York. After I get fixed wherever I go, I’ll tip her
off an’ she’ll send me the letters.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I got a aunt in Glens Falls,” Timmy said
brightening.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I got a aunt in New York, too!” Skippy added.
They all laughed at the coincidence, but Shorty
and Biff broke into the conversation eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I got Pop an’ Mom in New York!” Shorty announced
proudly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Me, too!” said Biff. “We leeve next door
Shorty an’ I bet they all crazy we don’t show at
Delafield.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They fell to talking about their parents proudly.
Nickie did some reminiscing about his aunt’s kindly
care of him and it seemed that Timmy had somewhat
the same story to tell. Skippy was listening
intently, but at the same time his mind was going
back to the night before when he had heard Devlin
denouncing Frost for having brought the two
Greeks along.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, fellers,” he said suddenly. “Shorty an’
Biff got parents, huh? You, Nickie, an’ Timmy an’
me—we ain’t got none. I heard Devlin an’ Frost
talkin’ last night—I couldn’t sleep so I heard what
they said. One thing I know was that Devlin was
burnin’ up, ’cause he asked Frost what was he
gonna do bout Shorty and Biff ’cause they’re
Greek’n’ he couldn’t pass ’em off for his sons. So
Frost says he’ll take ’em himself—one he’ll take to
Pittsburgh an’ the other to Maine. Anyway, Devlin
was mad that they came ’cause he said he didn’t
expect ’em. So you know what I think, fellers?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Spill it, kid,” Nickie said.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That Devlin picks on orphans a-purpose!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say,” Nickie said, admiringly, “that’s brains,
kid, an’ I don’t mean maybe. That’s callin’ the
turn. Holy Smoke, if that don’t seem like what
he’s doin’—the orphan racket, hah?” Nickie said
as if to himself. “I wonder why, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy grinned. “I doped out a little about him—maybe
I can dope out the rest, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here’s hopin’, kid,” Timmy said smiling.
“Anyways, even if you don’t, maybe when I find
what’s what an’ get shipped west—maybe I can tip
off the bulls so’s you guys won’t have no killin’ jobs
to do when Devlin puts the bee on you. It’d be
better to go to Delafield an’ get a couple years off
on good behavior than be in the spot I’m in tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” said Nickie thoughtfully, “that’s callin’
the shot, Timmy. Even my full stretch’d be better’n
what I’d get for goin’ along with Devlin.
Anyways, it ain’t no bad idea to tip off the dicks if
you can.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You speak crazy!” Biff interrupted. “Timmy
teep off, yes, but where he tell them deecks to find
us, eh? Do we know where we are, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The looks they exchanged were an admission of
defeat. After all, did Timmy know where he had
been this past month and a half—did any of them
in that damp, shadowy room have the slightest idea
where the lonely house was situated? New York
State? New Jersey? Pennsylvania? They might
have been in the vast, trackless wilderness of
Africa, so cleverly had Devlin concealed from them
the location of that dismal house.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was reminded then of the boy Tucker
about whom Mr. Conne had told him. Tucker
hadn’t known either where the house was located in
which Devlin had kept him imprisoned for a full
month. There was something very painstaking in
Devlin’s methods. He either completely confused
his reform school “protégés” by taking them to live
in a house and street which had its counterpart in
hundreds of other houses and streets or else he
confounded them utterly by driving them deep into
this swampy wilderness under cover of night.</p>

<p class='c008' >What were they to do?</p>

<p class='c008' >An idea came to Skippy—why not write a letter
and give it to Timmy to mail? In the next second,
he was thankful that the impulse hadn’t flourished
under cold reasoning for he suddenly realized that
Devlin would be just the man to anticipate that sort
of thing and Timmy would be relieved of any such
messages immediately. Also, he was reminded of
Carlton Conne’s warning: “Get in touch with no
one, kid—tell no one <i>anything</i> unless you’re certain
that it’s one of my men ... it’s the only way that
Dean Devlin can ever be caught ... and your
job, kid, is to help me set the trap!”</p>

<p class='c008' ><i>His job—to help set the trap!</i> What was he to
do?</p>

<p class='c008' >He was still asking himself that when Frost came
into the back yard in the noisy, ancient car. Devlin
had preceded him in the closed car and was already
locking it up in the barn.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Looks like they took the junk pile to get the big
guy’s closed car, hah?” Nickie said, not exactly at
ease.</p>

<p class='c008' >Timmy was looking over his shoulder, watching
through the shutters the backyard scene under Devlin’s
powerful flashlight. “Looks like I’m gonna
ride in the junk pile tonight,” he said simply. “I
wonder why, hey?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy felt suddenly choked and unable to utter
a sound and, judging by the silence, the other boys
were experiencing the same difficulty.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />HIS JOB</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Even if they had been capable of speaking afterward,
Devlin gave them little time. He came in,
hurried upstairs and came down again in a few
minutes, carrying a suitcase and wearing his usual
dark clothes. He ordered Frost to stay close to
the house until he returned. And without seeming
to see the silent, staring boys he nodded at Timmy
with some show of impatience.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Time’s short—come on!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy could still feel the strong, firm clasp of
Timmy’s handshake long after the ancient car clattered
out of the back yard. He felt restless, and
Nickie, that heroic defier of man-made petty laws,
seemed stunned and fearful.</p>

<p class='c008' >Shorty and Biff, a little too blunt to be long affected
by anything, were comfortably seated again
at the table arguing in their native tongue over a
game of cards. Frost was seated opposite them,
absorbed in a New York newspaper.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All along I been sorta thinkin’ we might be
layin’ it on kinda thick,” Nickie whispered at
Skippy’s side. “Know what I mean? Aw, I
thought mebbe we’d got thinkin’ the worsta Devlin
counta that funeral pan he’s got an’ the house an’
all—see? People get jumpy just talkin’ bout
ghosts, don’t they? Well, that’s what I mean—I
thought we got thinkin’ he’s a killer like Timmy
done an’ we couldn’t thinka him as nothin’ else. Up
till just before they beat it I tells myself mebbe it’s
just his old racket, the swindlin’ game that he’s
workin’ in a new way with us kids as fall guys—see?
But when I sees his face an’ his eyes all
funny an’ starin’ when he tells Timmy to c’mon, I
get feelin’ bad inside.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Me too,” Skippy agreed, after he had made certain
that Frost was not watching them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, kid,” Nickie said, between half-closed lips,
“I ain’t feelin’ we’re thinkin’ the worsta him now.
I’m feelin’ that mebbe he’s worse’n’ what we think,
he is—see!”</p>

<p class='c008' >They sauntered toward the table at that juncture
for Frost was looking up from his paper. His
shrewd, colorless eyes observed them and his thin
mouth was wrinkled mirthfully.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Something in this here paper might give you
kids a laff,” he chuckled. “Here, sit down and
read it—I gotta go up to my room and do a few
things.”</p>

<p class='c008' >He was still chuckling when he left the kitchen
but none of the boys paid him any attention then.
They were too interested in the page which Nickie
spread out and on which they read the headlines:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >There were two columns of the story. It had
been discovered that the car had been tampered
with and the driver told of being drawn into conversation
while he was waiting at the courthouse by
a “queer-looking man, dressed like a mechanic.”
Also, he described how the boys had been taken
from him at the point of a gun and how Dippy
Donovan had refused to escape. It was hinted at
the reformatory that the boy, because of his behavior,
stood a chance of having more than half his
sentence remitted.</p>

<p class='c008' >“They’d do that for us too, eh?” Shorty remarked
regretfully. “The time eet go quick then
an’ when we got out we go ’ome, eh? Now we
don’t go ’ome teel we do stretch. Now we go west
where Devlin send us. Always we are seeck for
’ome but we can’t go.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” said Nickie wistfully, “that’s the trouble.
It’s justa bad break. I never give it a tumble before
bout home, sweet home. All I thought was
what a joke on them dicks when we pull a fast one.
I never think how it ain’t such a joke goin’ west
where we can’t go home unless we take a rap. An’
it’ll be harder doin’ the stretch afterward than now—why
didn’ I thinka that, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I coulda told you if I hadn’t been out,” Skippy
said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, sure thing, kid. You got brains. Me, I
think I’m smart—see! I don’t think how I’m gonna
get homesick out west an’ wanta see my aunt an’
New York too. Holy Smoke, I don’t wanna be
dodgin’ dicks forever!” he added, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Bragging, laughing boy-heroes the day before,
they were all bitter and resentful now. Their
grand dream of escape, their defiance of the law,
had brought them nothing but disappointment, and
instead of knowing that each day brought them
nearer to freedom, they were to be forever pursued
by the spectral arm of the law. It threatened
them with a double punishment should they come
back voluntarily, yet it stood between them and
their homes if they evaded it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was absorbed in these thoughts just as if
he had been one of them. He no longer felt that
he was playing a part or acting as the spring of the
trap into which Mr. Conne hoped Devlin would
fall; he felt that the whole thing had become too
realistic and that the spring of the trap was
threatening to snap upon himself instead of Devlin.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie broke into his musing. “Aw, we ain’t
gettin’ nowheres by sittin’ here mopin’ about it,
hah? C’mon, kid, let’s play rummy.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy had been turning the pages of the paper,
giving them a cursory glance. As he turned to the
ninth page he saw a column marked <span class='sc'>PERSONAL</span> and
directly under it he saw his name. His heart
pounded furiously.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, later,” he said, trying to make his voice
sound calm. “I gotta read the baseball news.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie nodded absently for he was already absorbed
in a good hand of cards which Biff had just
dealt him. Skippy made certain that they were all
equally absorbed; also, he made certain that Frost
was still quiet upstairs. Then he proceeded to
read.</p>

<p class='c010' >SKIP: UNDERSTAND UNEXPECTED MOVE—SHOULD
HAVE PREPARED FOR THAT ... YOU MUST SEND
WORD SOMEHOW—IT’S YOUR JOB!... SIGNED
“BOSS.”</p>

<p class='c011' >He must send word—<i>somehow</i>! <i>It was his job!</i>
No one but Carlton Conne could have said it just
like that—no one but Carlton Conne could have
written it! And Skippy thrilled at the thought,
thrilled each time he read the vivid message. He
<i>would</i> get word to him somehow, particularly since
he had seen in print that it was his job to do nothing
else but! There was no doubt about it now.</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne had signed himself as <i>Boss</i>!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />A NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >A half hour later, Skippy had decided on one
phase of his job. He climbed the dusty stairway
and proceeded to the door of a room which no boy
had been allowed to enter.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost answered his knock but did not ask him in.
He had jumped up from a small, battered table
upon which he had been writing, and now he stood
in the open doorway, his colorless eyes searching
Skippy’s face in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Can you lend me some paper an’ pencil?” the
boy asked briskly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost’s eyes narrowed. “What for?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“To work out cross-word puzzles,” Skippy answered,
his eyes meeting Frost’s gaze unflinchingly.
“The kids are playin’ cards an’ I wanna do something.”
He laughed. “I work cross-word puzzles—every
night!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mm!” Frost seemed to be turning the thought
over and over. Finally, he walked to the table and
taking a bunch of keys from his pocket, he selected
one and opened a little drawer. When he came
back to the door he held out a pencil and two sheets
of ordinary note-paper. “Here, kid,” he said,
chuckling, “cross-word puzzle all night if you feel
like it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy took the paper smilingly but did not stop
for further conversation. He wasn’t taking any
chances and he hurried downstairs again before
Frost could think it over and perhaps recall him.</p>

<p class='c008' >For an hour, Skippy scribbled and wrote all over
one sheet of the paper. The other piece of paper
along with a pencil of his own he carefully concealed
under his belt. And, when the game of rummy
was broken up around midnight, the boy had torn
his scribbling sheet into a hundred bits and scattered
it on the table. Then when they went upstairs,
he returned the pencil to Frost.</p>

<p class='c008' >Fifteen minutes later, he saw the rim of light
disappear from under the door jamb and he knew
that Frost had blown out his lantern and was going
to bed. He waited breathlessly then and after
some minutes got out of bed and tiptoed to the
door where he listened intently.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was some time before he was rewarded with
the sound of Frost’s first labored snore. Then he
roused Fallon.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t make a sound, Nick,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I won’t, kid!” Nickie murmured sleepily.
Then he sat up. “What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m gonna write a note, Nickie—I’ll tell you
why after. What I want you to do is go over to
the door an’ listen for Frost’s snore. If he stops,
gimme the high sign. I’m gonna light the lantern
an’ take it over by the window. The light won’t
show into the hall from there.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Good dope, kid,” Nickie agreed, stepping out
onto the floor. “But what you gonna write with,
hah? You gave Frost back the pencil.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy winked. “I got my own, but I didn’t
wanna make him suspicious. I wanted some paper
so’s I could write this note tonight when I got the
chance. If I didn’t ask for a pencil, then he’d know
I had one—get me? I tore up the one sheet I scribbled
on—tore it up in a lotta pieces so’s he could
see it. He won’t know whether it’s one or two
sheets of his paper that I used an’ I’m takin’ a
chance he thinks it’s the two sheets. Anyway, I
don’t think he’ll give it a thought that I held back
the other sheet ’cause I give him back the pencil.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Kid, there’s no mud on you,” said Nickie
admiringly. “Get the lantern an’ write your note. I’ll
listen an’ if I hear a peep outa him, I’ll cough—see?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy got the lantern down from the hook on
the side wall. He took it over to the window and
set it down firmly on the sill, then spread out the
neatly folded note-paper and began to write:</p>

<p class='c012' >“After the accident we rode and rode—through
woods and every place, I don’t know where. It
was eight or nine o’clock when we got here, a terrible
lonesome house with swamp and woods all
round. It’s got bars all inside on the windows so
we can’t get out. A boy named Timmy Brogan
went with him tonight so a feller named Frost (his
pal) is here with us now. There’s three kids besides
me and maybe by the time you get this two
will be gone. Anyway, boss, all I can tell you about
it, is Frost said this house used to be in a village
but the village burned down all round it. So instead
of building up the village again the people
moved twenty-five miles away near a railroad—that
was seventy-five years ago. Frost says it’s the
house that people forgot and he says nobody knew
about it but a nit-wit hermit that died last year.
So this is all I know about where I am. I get headaches
kind of from it being so hot in this house with
all the shutters closed too, but outside of that, I’m
all right. Devlin’s terrible mysterious and queer
acting boss and the kid that went tonight said <i>he</i>
was a worse man than ever you think. Anyway, I
hope I can give this to somebody soon so you can
find out where we are and help us.... Skip”....</p>

<p class='c011' >Nickie was still a patient sentinel and he smiled
encouragingly. Skippy took heart and folded up
the note and wrote outside:</p>

<p class='c008' >“To Whoever Gets this Will they Please send
this to the Manhattan World, New York City ...
thanks.... And keep this a secret or else we’ll be
taken away and won’t get helped!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Below it, he added:</p>

<p class='c008' >“To the Editor of the Personal Column....
An Answer to Boss’ in Friday’s paper, August
19....”</p>

<p class='c008' >He put down his pencil and folded the note still
smaller. Then he got one of his shoes and slipped
the paper inside of the loose lining. After that, he
nodded to Nickie and putting the light out they
crawled into bed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Devlin’ll be takin’ one of us to go through that
doctor’s examination business soon’s he gets back,
Nickie,” Skippy whispered. “Whoever he takes,
will take that note ’cause it’ll bring us help if we
wait our chance an’ slip it to somebody we think we
can trust. We’ll pass somebody going back an’
forth to the doctor’s office an’ it’s better if it’s a
lady.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an <i>old</i> lady,” Nickie murmured, thinking
wistfully of his good aunt. “Them you can trust.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“For two reasons we shouldn’t give it to the
doctor,” Skippy warned. “Devlin might get wise,
an’ besides the doctor might be workin’ with Devlin.
So we gotta be careful, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You tell ’em! Kid, you’re a wonder at dopin’
out things. If it wasn’t for you, I’d be in the
dumps—you keep a guy all pepped up.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, it ain’t anything. I wanna help myself too,
don’t I? But I trust you, Nickie, honest. I
wouldn’t let you in on this if I didn’t. Shorty and
Biff are out ’cause I don’t feel sure of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, they’re too dumb. But take it from me—Nickie
Fallon’s been your pal from the minute
I saw you—see? An’ that means it’s all jake between
us. Justa show how much you can trust me,
kid, I won’t even read that note if I’m gonna be the
one to take it. I’ll keep it in my shoe till Devlin
ain’t lookin’ an’ I see that old lady. What you
wrote’s your business an’ I ain’t buttin’ in.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy knew that Fallon was sincere. And
though, at first, he was a little fearful that he had
not obeyed orders strictly to the letter, he knew
that Carlton Conne would understand that he <i>had</i>
to take Nickie into his confidence this little bit. He
had purposely refrained from sending the message
direct to the great detective or bringing the name
of the International Detective Agency into it in any
way lest the note should fall into unfriendly hands.</p>

<p class='c008' >After all, he told himself, no one, not even
Nickie, could guess who he was or the part he was
playing, from the contents of that note. Certainly,
Devlin wouldn’t guess, if he read it, that the man
addressed as “Boss” was the man who was determined
to track him down—none other than that
famous detective, Carlton Conne!</p>

<p class='c008' >He had done all that he could do now. They
had to be patient and wait until one or the other
could safely place the note in the hands of some
trustworthy person. Thus far they were safe and
sound, Skippy assured himself. At least they were
tonight.</p>

<p class='c008' >But what of tomorrow?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />A CHANGE OF PLANS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >The day dawned cloudy and gray and when
Skippy woke at eight o’clock he looked in vain for
a ray of heartening sunlight. Nothing but warm
air came in through the shutters and it was sticky
and close.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie sat up and stretched lazily. “Wow!
What a headache, kid,” he said, rubbing his forehead.
“How’s yours, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Bad as last night,” Skippy answered mournfully.
“We gotta expect headaches in a hot, dark house
like this, huh? Gee whiz, Nickie, sump’n’s gotta
happen to get us outa here soon or I’ll be like
Timmy, I guess. Here it’s only the second mornin’
an’ I feel like it’s a year.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie was up and listening at the door while
Skippy was talking. “Where is he?” he asked, on
the alert.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Frost went downstairs most an hour ago, so
don’t worry. I heard him walkin’ an’ walkin’
round his room just like he had sump’n on his mind.
Then all of a sudden he comes out into the hall’n’
locks his door like he always does an’ beats it downstairs.
Sump’n must be up.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was right—something was up. They
found out what it was when they appeared in the
kitchen for breakfast a few minutes later. Frost
was hurrying back and forth from the yard and
down to the cellar bearing pails of water from the
pump outside.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m putting five days’ water supply in the crock
down cellar,” he explained after his last trip.
“Keep the cover on it tight like I’m leaving it, and
it’ll stay fresh and cold. There’s canned stuff and
other grub so you can feed and I’ll show you how
else you can manage before I leave.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You beatin’ it?” Nickie asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mm,” Frost murmured. His colorless eyes
dropped before their gaze. And, as if to change
the subject, he asked: “D’ye know if them Greek
kids are awake?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, we didn’t hear a thing when we come down,”
Skippy answered promptly. Then, out of a clear
sky he hurled the query: “Why, you ain’t takin’
’em away, are you, Mr. Frost?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost was disconcerted. “Why—er—sure!” he
stammered. “I am! I—if Dev—if Barker comes
back—he should be here by Wednesday, tell him
there’s a note in the room explainin’ matters.” He
blinked his colorless eyes, then added: “I’m lockin’
you kids up for five days, but I’m leavin’ you the
run of the house—that’s how much I trust you!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Says you!” Nickie sneered.</p>

<p class='c008' >Points of color appeared upon Frost’s cheeks.
He glared at Fallon and asked, “What d’ye mean,
hey?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ain’t them ears pinned on your head?” was
Nickie’s retort. “It looks like we’re trusted with
bars all over the joint an’ even on the cellar winders,
hah? It looks like we’re trusted when the bars
ain’t even enough, so you hadda padlock all the
shutters too. Yeah, that stuff goes for Sweeny.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s Dev—Barker’s idea—not mine—get
me? Anyway, I ain’t got no time to argue. We’ll
hash it over when I get back,” Frost snapped.</p>

<p class='c008' >He turned, went upstairs and Nickie proceeded
with the making of coffee. Skippy got a package of
bacon from the cupboard and silently set about the
task of frying it. Words wouldn’t come—he could
do nothing but listen and wait. For what, he didn’t
know.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Shorty and Biff came downstairs and back
to the kitchen they were their usual smiling selves.
Nickie looked from his coffee pot to them and
Skippy’s eyes traveled back and forth from their
round faces to the briskly frying bacon.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Frost tell you he’s beatin’ it with you guys this
morning?” Nickie asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure,” Biff smiled.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And you ain’t nervous or nothin’, hah?” Nickie
asked, amazed that Biff could smile.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nah. The queecker we go, the queecker comes
the time we sneak home.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We theenk maybe we tell dees Frost we rather
not go to Peetsburgh or Maine or what it ees he
wants to take us,” Shorty spoke up. “We theenk
we ask heem to take us home so we can say hello,
then we go Delafield. Maybe they lop off time
for us too ’cause we come back, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Maybe,” Skippy said in a small voice.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You never can tell,” Nickie said, his eyes staring
into space.</p>

<p class='c008' >They ate in silence, a strange oppressive silence,
and Skippy felt almost glad when Frost’s hurried
steps sounded on the stairs. If it had to be, it was
better to have it over now than to endure the tension
of waiting and living in dread.</p>

<p class='c008' >A smile and a handclasp and they were gone.
Nickie and Skippy stood listening as Frost locked
the woodshed door from the outside. When the
car chugged softly outside they made no attempt
to go to the windows and look. Neither one moved
an inch until the sound of the motor had ceased
to echo in the clearing.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If I thought Frost didn’t have no gun, I’d
jumped him,” said Nickie at last. “But catch him
and Devlin in a racket like this without carryin’
rods, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was again reminded of Carlton Conne’s
assurance that Dean Devlin was not the gun-toting
kind of criminal. The boy had no doubt but that
that had been true of Devlin once, but not now.
Too, the detective had said that Devlin was after
people’s money—not people. In the light of what
Skippy now knew, that also was no longer true.
Devlin had evidently made rapid strides in criminality.
He had taken on a partner and whatever
his mystery racket was, the fact that he trafficked
in these convicted boys, evidently for gain, robbed
him completely of the superficial glamour his adventurous
life might have previously given him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, Nickie,” Skippy said at length, “we got five
days here alone an’ if we can’t do a Houdini in that
time we’re a coupla bums.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie’s face became radiant. “Gotta plan,
kid?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I gotta hunch maybe we can work loose a coupla
bars in some window! If we can’t find a crowbar,
maybe we’ll find sump’n else, huh? We’ll start
down cellar right away.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You said it, kid!” Nickie was enthusiastic.
“And when we scram outa this drum, I’ll say like
Biff and Shorty, we’ll go home’n’ say hello an’ then
tell the dicks we’re reportin’ for Delafield.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy thought of an old saying of his aunt’s
about an ill wind blowing someone some good.
Timmy, the Greeks, and now Nickie all seemed to
lose their defiance of the law under Devlin’s evil
roof. If it took an evil to cure an evil then their
contact with the arch criminal had not been entirely
in vain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />THE SEARCH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >The cellar yielded nothing in their search but
mouldy rubbish, ancient cobwebs and the stone crock
which Frost had indicated as their water supply. A
broken shovel which Skippy salvaged from one of
the rubbish piles was dragged upstairs with the forlorn
hope that it might prove useful if they found
nothing better.</p>

<p class='c008' >The kitchen cupboard was next attacked but after
an hour’s work they found that that too availed
them nothing. Warm and perspiring, they walked
through the gloomy rooms and sat down to rest in
the vast, almost dark parlor. Skippy looked
around at the chairs and sighed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ve gotta find sump’n, Nickie!” he said.
“It ain’t gonna be no joke sittin’ here an’ knowin’
we <i>could</i> get out if we had sump’n to work with!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t I know it, kid!” Nickie said, running his
fingers through his straight, black hair. “It’s like
night all the time in here an’ the empty rooms an’
creakin’ floors’d drive anybody nuts.” Suddenly
he straightened up, tense with a new idea. “Lissen,
kid! How bout their room, hah? They’d be
wise that we’d go huntin’ sump’n, so what they don’t
want us findin’ they lock in their room, hah?
That’s it—<i>their room</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, but it’s locked,” Skippy reminded him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, it’s locked,” Nickie admitted smilingly.
“But that’s where I come in—see? Whadda you
s’pose the dicks grabbed me for, hah? Listen,
there ain’t no lock I can’t pick if I stick at it long
enough. I’d pick them doors downstairs if they
wasn’t metal an’ outside locks.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy could not conceal his smile.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie grinned too. “Aw, don’t worry, kid.
It’ll be the last lock I ever pick.” Suddenly he was
serious and looked straight at Skippy. “Say, kid,
I can’t believe you ever beat the law even onct.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nope.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Holy Smoke! Framed, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sorta.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“If I could lay my mitts on the guy what....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, forget it, Nickie,” Skippy said, rising.
“When we get away we’ll talk about it, huh? Gee
whiz, I’m here an’ so we gotta be thinkin’ bout gettin’
out quick’s we can.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They went hopefully upstairs. Armed with a
small kitchen knife Nickie started operations at the
keyhole of the room which Frost and Devlin occupied
but it was late that afternoon when it yielded.</p>

<p class='c008' >They burst into this private and mysterious sanctum
with cries of joy, then stopped a little beyond
the threshold and surveyed the room with a feeling
of disappointment. It was furnished little better
than their room and aside from an old iron bed,
there was a single chair, a trunk, and a cracked
mirror which hung over the dilapidated writing
table.</p>

<p class='c008' >There were two windows, barred and shuttered
like the rest of the house. Skippy noticed that,
then walked to the far end of the room and opened
a closet door.</p>

<p class='c008' >“A ladder, Nickie!” he exclaimed, joyfully. “I
betcha it’s a ladder for the attic!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an’ what we gonna do up in the attic,
hah, kid?” Nickie asked. “Even if there wasn’t no
bars to them winders up there, what’d we do, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did I say I knew what we’d do? Ain’t it
sump’n that we found sump’n? Gee whiz, it’s
sump’n that the ladder gets us <i>somewheres</i>, even if
it’s the attic where we can’t do anything.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie’s keen, smiling eyes had already found
something of interest on the writing table. “A note
to the big cheese, kid. From Frost. It’s short
and sweet. C’mon, take a look.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy picked up the paper and read: “I got a
great scheme early this morning, boss, so I’m taking
the Greeks to Pittsburgh—get me? I thought no
use hanging round here till you got back ... I
could have things moving, maybe even over by that
time. I won’t hog the price on account of what you
said but I thought I can kill two birds with one
stone. I can have two Greek sons as well as one,
can’t I? Now, I’m going so I’ll see you when I
get back....” It was unsigned.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie looked disappointed. “Still we don’t
know what their racket is, hah? There’s a price
an’ I wonder what for? S’help me, kid, I’m
stumped.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Me too,” Skippy admitted, opening the table
drawer curiously and peering inside. He drew out
a small memorandum book and opened it. Suddenly
he whistled. “If you wanna know what the
price’s for, this’ll tell us, Nickie. Gee whiz, here’s
prices <i>an’ how</i>! He’s got a price for us.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’re crazy!” Nickie said. “A price for us?”</p>

<p class='c008' >He soon saw with his own eyes that Devlin had
listed boys, prices, dates and places over a period
of several months. Also, it was quite evident that
there had been little variation in the means by
which they came into the man’s dubious protection.
Against Timmy Brogan’s name was listed a price
of $2,500. At the top of a page, underlined in
red, was the name of Tucker, who seemed to have
been a $3,000 loss to Devlin.</p>

<p class='c008' >Turning the next page, which bore a date two
days old, the boys looked at their own names.
Nickie was rated at $3,000 and Skippy at $2,500.
Shorty and Biff were question-marked at $1,000,
and in parentheses the probable price of $500 each
was printed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“At three grand I’m the most expensive guy in
the bunch,” Nickie laughed nervously. “How you
make it out?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy shrugged. “You’re askin’ me! What’s
all these prices for us anyway, huh? Why do they
all go from $500 to $3,000—what could it be for?
Gee whiz, Nickie, we ain’t gettin’ anywheres with
this.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t I know it, kid? We should worry about
what we don’t know. Let’s look through the trunk
an’ the closet an’ if that ain’t no help, we’ll go up
in the attic an’ chase rats.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy laughed. “An’ how!” he said. “If we
can’t get out we can give the rats a break anyway,
huh? Devlin might put a price on ’em if he comes
back an’ finds ’em here.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Without any definite motive, Skippy walked over
to the back window and looked out through a good-sized
chink in the shutters where two of the slats
had fallen out. A rain barrel stood just beneath
the window, and on the surface of the water a green
slime had gathered, an excellent playground for
mosquitoes.</p>

<p class='c008' >He watched it for a moment, then with a sudden
idea, he let the notebook slip from his hands and
saw it slide down the side of the building and out
of sight behind the rain-barrel.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, you gone nuts?” Nickie exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t know,” Skippy answered honestly.
“I’m playin’ a hunch—don’t ask me why! It was
like—aw, you know what I mean, Nickie—like
Fate!”</p>

<p class='c008' >It <i>was</i> Fate—Skippy was to realize that before
another twenty-four hours had passed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />HOPE IN THE ATTIC</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Shadows of early evening were beginning to
creep over the silent swamp land before the boys hit
upon a practicable plan of escape. They had had
two hours’ hunt through the dust-choked attic, braving
a seventy-five year accumulation of rubbish
which generations of rats had chewed and scattered
to its four corners.</p>

<p class='c008' >They found a trunk of ancient vintage that still
held up sufficiently to enable them to sit down and
rest upon it. Before them, the front attic window
offered possibilities and they were discussing it pro
and con. Also, they had been able to open it and
because it lacked shutters they enjoyed what was
left of the daylight and welcomed the occasional
damp, warm breeze that blew in.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy had found in the rubbish a coil of rope
that was in excellent condition. Nickie had come
upon what apparently had been the handle of an
antique iron pot, and the two discoveries had
formed the nucleus of their present discussion.</p>

<p class='c008' >The giant evergreen of poor Timmy’s dream
spread its lofty boughs within a few yards of the
small window. “That pot handle’s strong enough
to wedge out those bars, Nickie,” Skippy was saying
thoughtfully. “It’ll take maybe a coupla hours,
’cause I guess they’re in there pretty tight. When
we get that done, I’ll lasso that tree an’ tie it
pretty tight somewheres in here.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I getcha, kid!” Nickie said enthusiastically.
“We swing out along it hand over hand, hah?
Then, when we hit a strong-lookin’ branch we drop
an’ zip, we’re on the ground fore we know it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, that’s it. It’s the only way. We been
all over this house an’ this is the best we can do.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure. It’s work but ain’t it worth it? Anyways,
kid, let’s put the bag on. We ain’t had no
chow all day, we been so busy turnin’ this place upside
down. How about it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee whiz, I most forgot I had a stomach—honest!
I can’t thinka nothin’ but gettin’ away.
But I’m hungry, that’s a fact.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, me too. Even them canned beans’ll taste
like turkey tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Beans!</i>” Skippy said disgustedly. “It’ll be nice
to eat sump’n besides canned beans n’ stale crackers
n’ coffee. Gee whiz, I like milk, I do—cold,
creamy milk!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an’ I like soup, kid. Nice, hot, creamy
soup like my aunt makes.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“C’mon, Nickie, let’s get eatin’ an’ get it over
with!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Just as they descended the ladder they heard, far
in the east, a low rumble of thunder. Before they
had started to feast on their beans, there was no
doubt that a storm was fast approaching. The
wind was rising steadily and the swaying trees made
eerie sounds which they could plainly hear during
frequent lapses of conversation.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hope it ain’t gonna be like the other night,”
Skippy said earnestly. “The room was hot but I
shivered just the same. An’ then Timmy havin’
that dream an’ screamin’ like he did....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, I was glad I was asleep. Outside this
graveyard, there ain’t nothin’ gives me the jitters
worse’n a bad storm. Holy Smoke, I ain’t myself
then.”</p>

<p class='c008' >There was a terrific clap of thunder and the wind
screeched mockingly past the kitchen windows. A
shutter somewhere on the house creaked uneasily
on its rusted hinges. The boys put down their
coffee cups and looked at each other.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Takes a hard storm like this for clearin’ the
air,” said Nickie profoundly. “My aunt always
says that. Remember since the other night it’s been
so gloomy—ain’t even seen no sun since we been
here. Maybe it’ll be clear tomorrer.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, maybe.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Anyways, kid, will we beat it right off if we get
them bars loose tonight?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, if we get ’em loose. But it ain’t gonna be
so easy, Nickie.”</p>

<p class='c008' >And it wasn’t easy—not at all. They took
turns at the top bar and after an hour succeeded in
making it yield only a little and on one side at that.
The lantern light was feeble and they dared not use
two lamps at a time, for they had made the discovery
before climbing to the attic that the oil
supply which Frost had left them was too low to be
used freely.</p>

<p class='c008' >The wind screamed around under the eaves and
presently blew the rain through the open window.
Vainly, they tried to close it but having been in
disuse for so many years the frame had warped and
Skippy soon decided that it would take a chisel and
hammer to get results.</p>

<p class='c008' >“How about them newspapers in the cellar, kid?”
Nickie suggested. “We can pin ’em up against
there while we work.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Pin ’em with what? Gee whiz, use your bean.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, you’re right, kid. We gotta get wet an’
like it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not if you wanna quit till tomorrow. An’ I
don’t like to do that, Nickie. Sump’n tells me do
what we can tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just’s you say, kid. I’m gettin’ so’s I feel
you’re a reg’lar mascot—see? I ain’t doin’ nothin’
without you sayin’ it’s K. O.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy grinned and took his turn at the window.
The thunder was rolling away into the distance but
the heat lightning blazed across the black sky at
frequent intervals. The moaning wind echoed back
and forth mournfully and the rain made a hissing
noise as it lashed the window sill.</p>

<p class='c008' >Fallon had pulled the trunk as near the window
as possible. He made a doleful picture sitting there,
the lantern held at arm’s length so as to give Skippy
light. His pale face was in a half-shadow and his
narrow shoulders drooped dejectedly. Suddenly he
looked up and his black eyes were questioning.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hear a noise, kid?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy stopped his tugging at the top bar and
shook his head. “What kinda noise?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Like somebuddy runnin’. Maybe I’m crazy—just
hearin’ things.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“The wind an’ the rain, I betcha,” Skippy said,
getting back to his task. “It’ll last all night—I
think it’s gettin’ cooler.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an’ you’n me’s gettin’ wetter. We’ll be
plenty cool by the time we get through. Gimme
a whack at it now, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wait a minute. I ain’t tired yet—it’s loosened
a little more.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie sighed. “Just on one side yet, hah?
Holy smoke, at that speed....” Then, suddenly:
“Kid, I hear somebuddy! Somebuddy runnin’!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Before Skippy could answer they were startled by
a cry that seemed to come from the clearing.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />TIMMY?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Nickie jumped up and held the lantern high over
their heads. They looked down into the clearing
but for a long time the black night and the screaming
wind and rain obscured their vision. Skippy
thought he saw something moving but he wasn’t
sure.</p>

<p class='c008' >Again a thin, piteous scream pierced the storm.
<i>Nickie—Kid?</i> Can’t you guys hear me?
It’s <i>me</i>—<i>Timmy</i>!“</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Timmy!</i>” Skippy shouted. “What....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Listen,” came the cry, “I wanta tell you guys
... that’s why I come back ... I’m hurt—I
don’t know how I found this place, honest! Somethin’
made my feet run this way so’s I could tell you
... he’s got no heart ... he’s....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ll come down, Timmy—in front!” Skippy
shouted. “Downstairs!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It won’t do no good!” came the answer. “You
can’t get out unless he leaves you—then beat it for
your life!” There was a pause, then: “Frost
... where’s he?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“He ain’t here, Timmy!” Nickie cried, finding his
voice. He swung the lantern higher and then, for
the first time, they could see the slight form swaying
down by the evergreen tree.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I just come back to tell you.” Timmy’s voice was
a heart-rending sob. “He’s what I told you ...
it’s a trick! He makes out somethin’s wrong with
the car an’ he makes me get behind the wheel n’
tells me to step on the gas an’ come toward him.
It’s dark an’ I see him standing there up the road....
I don’t know ... when I get most to him he
jumps an’ it’s a bridge.... I go right over in the
car!” He groaned audibly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We gotta get out an’ help you, Timmy!” Skippy
cried.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m goin’ right away—you can’t get out, you
know you can’t!” After a pause, he cried: “Listen,
it wasn’t no accident—I hit my head on the way
down an’ in the water when I come up I yelled an’
I knew he was standin’ up on the bridge ... he
wouldn’t help me ... he just stood waitin’ for me
to drown I But I didn’t ... I grabbed a log an’
pushed myself up an’ he didn’t see me climb
up....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Where’s <i>he</i>?” Nickie called nervously.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He was up there—on the bridge—when I
sneaked away through the trees ... he acted like
he was waitin’ for a car to come along. I didn’t
meet any ... anyhow, all I could think of was to
come here an’ tip you off.... I was sick.... I
slep’ in the woods all day and ... I knew he
wouldn’ be here—I knew he’d be lookin’ in the lake
for me.... <i>Listen!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >The lantern swayed in Nickie’s trembling hand.
The light flickered and sputtered with each fresh
onslaught of the wind. Skippy held the top bar
and pressed his face into the opening, his heart
beating like a triphammer. There was a sound in
the distance and the fear of what it might be caused
him to gulp with dismay.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>It’s a car!</i>” Timmy screamed. “A car!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’d you come for, Timmy?” Nickie shouted
frantically.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Run! Hide!</i>” Skippy was crying.</p>

<p class='c008' >Timmy’s slim form seemed to be swaying uncertainly.
He took a few steps nearer the great tree,
acting as if he were bewildered.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy no longer heard the sound and said so.
Nickie agreed with him. They cried down to
Timmy to hurry—to run, but the boy looked up at
them vaguely and shrugged his shoulders mechanically.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s too sick—too hurt!” Skippy cried, pulling
at Nickie’s sleeve. “He don’t seem to move, he
can’t!”</p>

<p class='c008' >The lantern seemed to be making a desperate
effort to light up the scene. Its rays struggled high
over Nickie’s head and shone down almost brightly
for a precious moment, down upon Timmy’s upturned
face.</p>

<p class='c008' >He was smiling ... or did they imagine it?
His regular features slowly froze—froze into a
horrified expression ... or were they imagining
that too? And that arm that stole out from behind
the great evergreen.... Suddenly, there was a
muffled scream, a voice that sounded like Timmy’s.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then the lantern light went out, leaving them in
darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />DO DREAMS COME TRUE?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Nickie was clinging to him and making funny
little noises deep in his throat. Skippy let him
cling, for he was shaking from head to foot himself
and he blinked his eyes in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You seen <i>him</i>—you seen—” Skippy stammered,
frightened at the sound of his own voice.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t know what I seen,” Nickie said, his
words scarcely audible because of his chattering
teeth. “I—that scream—you heard that, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, and I seen him look terrible. Lissen!”
Mechanically, they put out their hands to feel for
the window and pressed close to it oblivious of the
fresh downpour of rain which swept in upon them,
drenching them to the skin. The gale screamed its
hardest, the lantern creaked in Nickie’s shaking
hand like some spectral voice out of the night, but
that was the only sound to reach their listening ears.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Timmy!</i>” Skippy called suddenly. “Timmy—<i>answer</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You hurt, Timmy?” Nickie’s query was pathetic.</p>

<p class='c008' >A tense silence seemed to beat upon their ears
and for a while they had difficulty in even listening
to the noises of the storm. Their eagerness to
hear Timmy’s thin voice had plunged them into a
temporary oblivion from which they recovered with
a start.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You believe in spooks?” Nickie asked in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nope.” Skippy gulped. “Why?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Call once again, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy called, loud and long.</p>

<p class='c008' >The wind screamed in answer, mockingly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Let’s beat it downstairs an’ have some light,
hah?” After a pause: “You ain’t got matches, I
s’pose?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Would I be standin’ here in the dark?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie’s throat was full of noises. “We better
be careful goin’ down the ladder—say, we didn’t
leave the lantern in the hall lighted.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“An’ the one in the kitchen too,” Skippy reminded
him grimly. “There ain’t no light till we
get to the kitchen n’ find a match.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie stopped short. “Where’s that rope an’
that iron handle?” he asked fearfully.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I hid ’em under that rubbish by the window just
now. So go on. Le’s get down.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie sighed. “I oughta knowed you wouldn’t
forget nothin’ even at a time like this.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They groped their way down the ladder and
waited for a moment in the upper hall listening to
the various sounds throughout the house and the
noise of the storm. They could not see each other
and they instinctively pressed their bodies close together.
Nickie had his hand through Skippy’s arm
and clung to it tightly. Then by a mutual impulse
they moved toward the stairway with measured
steps, their ears strained and listening for all that
their eyes could not see.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a long and awesome journey to the bottom
of the stairway and once there they had a whispered
consultation as to whether to go around through the
rooms to the kitchen or march straight past the
cellar door and so on into the room. Skippy decided
on keeping to the hall even though it meant
passing the door to the dim regions below.</p>

<p class='c008' >They had not taken two steps in that direction,
when Nickie gave vent to a blood-curdling scream.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>What?</i>” Skippy cried frantically.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>My foot!</i>” Nickie was gasping in the dark.
“Sump’n run over my foot!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>A rat!</i>” Skippy said, disgustedly. “I said to
shut that cellar door, Nickie!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh my head!” Nickie groaned. “I was scared
skinny. Kid, let’s run.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was human enough to accede and they
made the kitchen in one breath-taking bound.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie let go his hold on the other’s arm.
“Whew!” he said nervously. “Gimme a match.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, that’s what I say,” Skippy said, moving
noisily about the room. “They ain’t on this stove—I’ve
felt all over. Say, you lit that lantern we
took up to the attic.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, I did. Wha’d I do with them matches?”
Nickie asked himself desperately.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was another day before he found out, and in
the interim they had decided that there was no
other room in the house which offered the comparative
peace of their own room. At least they could
shut themselves in there. And that they did, not
stopping until they had pushed their heavy bed tight
against the stout oaken door.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What we afraid of, huh?” Skippy asked in a
small voice. They had undressed and were in bed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I dunno, kid!” Nickie admitted honestly. “I’m
kinda broke up in a hundred pieces like, since that
scream.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Timmy’s?</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, was it sure enough him?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, sure—gee whiz, who else....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s why I ast if you believe’n spooks!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nickie! Gee whiz, we heard Timmy talkin’—didn’t
he tell us twas all a trick with Devlin—didn’t
he say Devlin meant to kill him and....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an’ ain’t that like his dream the other
night? Ain’t it like he comes back in his dream an’
stands under that big tree? Ain’t it all in his dream
how he’s tellin’ us up at the winder an’ warnin’ us,
when zip, he sees this arm come out an’ pretty soon
he feels like he’s chokin’? How do we know he
ain’t kicked off somehow last night an’ tonight he
comes back from the dead, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Frightened as he was, Skippy could not help smiling
into the darkness. “Say, I thought you was a
real tough guy when I first spotted you. An’ here
you’re talkin’ bout spooks an’ comin’ back from the
dead like you’re a regular sissy.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie did not protest. Something had happened
to him and he was incapable of explaining
just what it was. The tough guy, as Skippy termed
it, no longer existed, for Nickie had looked upon
an evil which had shaken him to his very soul. He
did not know it then, but the small sins which were
directly responsible for his present predicament had
gone, never to return.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I dunno, kid,” he said, slowly, “but it’s like I’m
payin’ for doin’ what I done an’ makin’ my aunt
cry an’ worry after she brought me up. I knowed
it worried her but I kep’ on stubborn-like so now I
got it good! Long’s I live I won’t never forget
Timmy’s scream, whether it was him’r his spook!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Maybe it was good then that this happened,”
Skippy said practically. “Whether it was Timmy’s
ghost or not.” But after a pause, he added, fearfully:
“Gee whiz, Timmy <i>can’t</i> be dead!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I think different, kid. I think he is!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But we heard him talk, Nickie. You an’ me, we
heard it like we hear each other talkin’ now, didn’t
we?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure. But ain’t it funny, kid, how it’s all like it
was in that dream he told us about?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll say it’s funny. It’s like his dream so much
that it gives me the creeps. Even to the part where
he told us how he stood by the evergreen tree an’
then sudden like when he’s warnin’ us to beat it,
them arms reached out n’ grabbed him an’ he felt
like he was chokin’ to death. Gee whiz! If the
two of us didn’t hear him speak, I’d say there was
sump’n spooky about it. We even heard the car!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, we did. An’ we see somethin’ dark like a
guy’s arms reach out from behind that tree, didn’t
we?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I couldn’t swear I did, Nickie. It chokes me
when I think of it. Lissen, you don’t think that
was really Devlin—that he could really ki—kill
Timmy?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Kid, since I been here, I don’t know what’s real
an’ what ain’t—see? All I know is I’ll go nutty if
there’s any more goin’s on like we see tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was of the same mind, but he didn’t say
so. He would have given much to know just how
much was imagination and how much was stark
reality. Timmy’s empty cot, a vague shadow
against the side wall, did much to keep these dreadful
thoughts in his mind. Through wearying hours
the scream of his dreams and his scream in the
clearing seemed to echo mockingly through the
storm. Skippy felt exhausted, yet all through
the long night the question revolved in his mind.</p>

<p class='c008' >Was it a dream come true?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />DEVLIN’S RETURN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Nickie slept after a long time but Skippy was not
so fortunate. Not until the storm settled down
into a steady pattering rain with the early morning
hours did he find himself dozing, yet always waking
suddenly, trembling, and with his heart beating
rapidly in his breast.</p>

<p class='c008' >During one of these quiet intervals in which he
was dozing, he thought he dreamed that he heard
the sound of a car. He did not wake at once, but
kept listening for it again in a more or less semi-conscious
state. Suddenly, however, he was sure
that he heard footsteps down in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008' >For a moment he felt frozen with terror. Then
he gathered himself together and shook Nickie
firmly. “Don’t speak, Nickie!” he whispered.
“Just <i>lissen</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie was wide awake and alert, but he did not
move a muscle. “I hear it, kid,” he murmured.
“Somebuddy in the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yep. I’m frozen like.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Me too. What’ll we do, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Stay where we are when we ain’t got a light.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Right. I forgot. Who d’you think tis?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Lissen!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >They listened intently. A muffled cough, the
sound of something metallic falling, nothing escaped
them. The footsteps were measured and
heavy and seemed to circle the kitchen interminably.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sounds like <i>him</i>, kid!” Nickie whispered fearfully.
“I know them big feeta his’n. He’s got the
biggest dogs I ever seen. Ever notice?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nope.” Skippy thought how queer that Nickie
should speak of such details at a fearful time like
this. But people did that—he was beginning to
realize that one was apt to say and do almost anything
strange in moments of distress.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, kid!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“If it’s <i>him</i> ... what bout that lock I picked
in his room ... what about the ladder?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I been thinkin’,” Skippy answered breathlessly.
“Lissen, Nick—you don’t know nothin’ bout that
lock, neither do I! Frost said sump’n about how
he lost his keys when he was beatin’ it with Shorty
and Biff—get me? He musta picked the lock himself.
We found the door that way when we come
upstairs after they blew. We were lookin’ for a
ladder to go up in the attic—we wanted to go up
an’ snoop round for sump’n to do. We seen the
closet door standin’ open an’ there was the ladder.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oke, kid. But s’pose he’s leary bout us wantin’
to go up in the attic?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I gotta hunch he won’t be—much. We didn’t
wedge the bar enough so’s he’d notice it less he
went up an’ looked close. Even then he’d know it’d
be too far to jump out the winder an’ he won’t get
wise bout the tree less he sees the rope. Gee
whiz, I’m glad I hid it, I am.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I could cry, I’m so glad, kid. This racket’s too
spooky for me to think up an alibi quick. Holy
smoke, you’re a life-saver!”</p>

<p class='c008' >At heart, Skippy felt no such assurance. He was
shaking from head to foot and he dreaded Devlin
as he dreaded Death. He shuddered at the unconscious
simile and wondered if the very thought itself
did not portend the evil which Timmy had come
back to warn them of.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie’s cold, clammy hand stole over and
grasped his trembling wrist. Unashamed, they interlaced
their fingers and clasped them so firmly
that it hurt. Nevertheless, they derived a sort of
comfort from the contact and breathed more freely
even after the heavy feet below tramped out of the
kitchen and they heard the measured tread into the
hall.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s comin’, I bet!” Skippy whispered feverishly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie was mumbling a prayer that his aunt had
taught him in babyhood, a prayer that he thought
he had forgotten long ago. He dared not speak,
nor think, for fear of screaming and acting like a
weak, hysterical girl. The prayer and Skippy’s
warm fingers pressing against his own kept him
from losing his head entirely.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then they heard the footsteps on the stair!</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy listened, his head numb and his body trembling.
The house seemed to shake with the vibration
of each step. To the frightened boys it
sounded like a dirge, for the stairs creaked and
groaned and the flooring, rotting with age and disuse,
emitted eerie thumpings throughout the dismal
house.</p>

<p class='c008' >The darkness added much to their terrible fear,
for they could not see each other and it had the
effect of seeming to make them the more helpless.
Skippy felt during those terrible seconds that he
would not be able to raise a hand in his own
defense.</p>

<p class='c008' >So they waited, counting each heavy step and
listening with increasing dread as they came nearer.
It seemed to take an interminable time for those
feet to span the distance between the top of the
stairway and the door of their room. They
squeezed each other’s fingers tensely.</p>

<p class='c008' >At last the footsteps ceased—not at their door,
but across the hall!</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy gulped hard. Whoever it was, he was
discovering that the door had been opened, the lock
picked ... now he knew that his memorandum
book was gone ... now he had noticed that the
ladder had been taken from the closet.</p>

<p class='c008' >They heard him rush out of the room and to the
rear of the hall where they had left the ladder
standing propped against the attic opening. Skippy
could see the feeble glimmer of the lantern as it
cast a lonely ray under their door.</p>

<p class='c008' >Time stood still after that; they seemed to be in a
state of suspended animation. Skippy could not
hear Nickie breathe; Nickie listened in vain for a
heart beat from Skippy’s breast. The only sound
that reached their ears was that of the rushing footsteps
coming back now along the hall and suddenly
stopping before their door.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then the doorknob rattled.</p>

<p class='c008' >The door did not give, of course; the bed was
too tightly jammed against it. The boys waited and
presently they knew that there was a desperate
effort being made to open the door, for the bed
vibrated from the impact. Finally there came a
furious pounding on the oaken panel.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Fallon—Kid?” the familiar, deep voice called
insistently. “You boys there?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy felt then that his time had come.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />NICKIE REASONS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“You deaf?” came the funereal query. “Who’s
in there?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie was gulping audibly, but he could not
speak. Skippy was forced to do something about it
though every instinct within him rebelled against
opening that door to Devlin. He pressed Nickie’s
hand, then released it and sat up straight.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Huh? Who—who’s there?” he asked, feigning
sleepiness.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Me—Barker! Who’d you think?” was the
harsh reply. Then: “What’s holding this door—<i>open
it!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy stepped out of the bed on feet of ice. “A
m-m-minute,” he said, in a quivering voice. “J-J-just
a-a minute.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie seemed urged into action too. He jumped
out and sprang to Skippy’s side. “No matter what,
kid,” he gasped quickly, “you’n me are pals—see?
It’s him or us n’ we’ll stick! You do the talkin’
an’ I’ll watch his mitts. He’s a big guy but there’s
two against one!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes,” breathed Skippy, and together they pulled
the bed away from the panel. As the door flew
open, Devlin stood partly in the shadow, his face
black with wrath. His eyes, so light and staring,
seemed now to be on the verge of popping out of his
long, narrow head, and his beetle brows were all but
obscured by the straggling wisps of his unkempt
hair.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s the big idea, eh?” he demanded, glaring
at the boys and then at the bed.</p>

<p class='c008' >His voice sounded almost like a clap of thunder
and all Skippy could do was to look at the man’s
enormous feet. He had never noticed them before
and they fascinated him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Have you lost your voices, <i>eh</i>?” Devlin roared.
“<i>Answer me!</i>” There was no mistaking his anger.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee whiz, mister—a—,” Skippy stammered,
“we was sound asleep n’ all of a sudden we heard
you poundin’ on the door an’....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Shut up and answer my question! What’s the
idea of the bed against the door? What’s the idea
of Frost gone? The lock picked and the room
ransacked?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We didn’t touch nothin’ but the ladder, mister,”
Skippy answered, feeling more courage. “We don’t
know nothin’ bout the lock—it was like that when
we come upstairs looking for a ladder. We wanted
sump’n to do so we thought we’d go up in the attic
n’ look round ’cause it’s fun on a rainy night
an’....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Where’s Frost gone?” It was like the roar of
a lion.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy cringed inwardly but he managed to smile
in Devlin’s face. “He just went, that’s all. He
said he left a note explainin’ things an’ he said somethin’
about losin’ his keys an’ he was lookin’ all
round for ’em. Then he went upstairs n’ he was
up a long time an’ then he come down.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“A lot of good you are!” Devlin rumbled deep in
his throat. “What’s the matter with you, Fallon—can’t
you talk any more, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“The kid’s tellin’ what happened, Dev——”</p>

<p class='c008' >It was out!</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin glared. “Who told you to call me that?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Timmy told us Frost called you that.” Nickie
too, was quite calm now.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He did, did he?” The man’s eyes narrowed.
“Well, let it pass, it don’t matter now—this is my
last month in this house, anyway, and no dick will
hear that I’m Devlin through....” He stopped,
as if bewildered, but only for a moment. Then he
asked: “Which one of the Greeks did he take?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Both,” Skippy said quietly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Both!</i>” Devlin was plainly beside himself and
he made no further attempt to conceal it. He
stepped back into the hall, waving his long arms
from side to side. “He did, did he! So he took
’em both, eh? Well, I’ll show ... where’s the
note?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How’d we know?” Skippy retorted. “We
looked for a ladder, that’s all, n’ it wouldn’t be
where there was a note, would it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >If Devlin heard that, he gave no sign. He
stalked into his room and was even then in possession
of the note. While he read it, he ran his
long, hairy fingers back and forth through his hair.</p>

<p class='c008' >“His hair’s wet, kid—awful wet!” Nickie whispered.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy nodded grimly. “An’ his feet, Nick—look
at ’em—they’re covered with mud! Looks
like he’s been walkin’ through plenty.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie shivered, but they said no more for Devlin
had already read the note and was tearing it into
a hundred pieces. Also, he was looking at the boys
and a hard, cold glitter was in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You boys still haven’t told me what you had the
bed up against the door for?” he asked, with a hint
of cunning in his suddenly modulated tones.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was quick to sense this and he gathered
his wits to match Devlin’s. Naïvely, he answered:
“Maybe it’s sissy-like for guys to get scared, mister,
but we was never so scared as we was tonight when
we was up in that attic. We was lookin’ through
one of those old trunks and all of a sudden we heard
somebody runnin’.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, runnin’ like nobuddy’s business,” Nickie
added, with narrowed eyes upon Devlin. “An’
like he told us in his dream, who do we see standin’
down there like a ghost, but Timmy!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin’s face looked almost black, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, we was scared, an’ how!” Skippy said excitedly.
“It was rainin’ so hard an’ the wind was
blowin’ so we couldn’t hear hardly nothin’ he said.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You couldn’t?” Devlin’s query was almost too
eager.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie sighed with understanding and Skippy
went on, “All we heard him say was somethin’ bout
somebody bein’ hurt. Maybe it was him, I don’t
know. Anyway, mister, we told him we couldn’t let
him in ’cause Frost was away an’ we told him he better
run an’ go back where he come from. So he stood
there awhile an’ said sump’n about a car stoppin’ an’
all of a sudden the wind blew our lantern out ’cause
we opened the window an’ couldn’t shut it again.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an’ Timmy musta went away then,”
Nickie finished. “The kid an’ me we calls n’ calls
so after I says to the kid, maybe we only imagined
it was Timmy, hah? We been talkin’ so much bout
the nightmare he had that night, I says I guess we
had it on the brain. It was some spooky here tonight
with the storm an’ all, an’ a guy can imagine
a lot.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You must have imagined a terrible lot!” Devlin
said gravely. “The last I saw of Timmy Underwood,
he was waving to me from the window of a
train bound for Montana.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy stood speechless and Nickie walked helplessly
to the bed and sat down.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I suppose the whole thing made you a little
nervous,” Devlin said, staring down at the dilapidated
writing table. He coughed. “This is a
quiet place, specially during a storm. But boys
your age being so nervous as to push the bed....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We couldn’t find no match to light a lantern,”
Skippy said, feeling limp.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an’ I didn’t want no spooks creepin’ in on
me,” Nickie added. “Live ones, I ain’t afraid
of....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nonsense! The best thing you boys can do is
to go to bed and forget it. I’m a little tired myself.”
After a pause, he added: “I’m taking you
boys, somewhere in the morning so wake up early.
Goodnight!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy couldn’t get the door closed quickly
enough. He threw himself on the bed exhausted.
“Am I glad that’s over!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Same here, kid,” Nickie agreed in a faint voice.
“Our little date with him tomorra ain’t worryin’ me
like what Frost’s gonna say bout that lock when he
gets back.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Keep your shirt on. From what Devlin’s
looked an’ from what he ain’t said about Frost,
makes me think there’ll be plenty trouble between
<i>them</i> so the lock won’t look big. Anyway, we
can deny it, can’t we? Frost’s double-crossed Devlin
a little, I think, so will Devlin believe all he says
again, huh? Our word’s as good as Frost’s.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Kid, I’m a dumb-bell again, ain’t I? While
you’re makin’ the old bean work I’m worryin’ bout
Devlin’s mitts.” Suddenly he lowered his voice
still more and whispered close to Skippy’s ear,
“What’s the idea sayin’ we didn’ hear nothin’ that
Timmy said?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We gotta outsmart <i>him</i>! While he thinks we
ain’t on to nothin’, he won’t be so foxy. Take it
from me, Nickie, if we tell him nothin’ we got a
chance—not unless.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What a guy!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“If he thought we thought there was really
sump’n phoney bout him an’ Timmy tonight, we
couldn’t breathe no more without him knowin’ it.
He’s gonna be foxy anyhow, but he’d be worse if he
knew what we was thinkin’ an’ I betcha I’m right.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You didn’t fall for that about him seein’ Timmy
off on that train for Montana, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We seen Timmy down in the clearin’—we seen
him with our own eyes, didn’ we?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Devlin looked like a minister when he said he
seen Timmy wavin’ on that, train. Could a guy be
lyin’ an’ look like that?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s why they call him Dean,” Skippy murmured,
thinking of what Carlton Conne had told
him of the man’s record. “He fools people ’cause
he looks like a saint. Sure, he can lie—he don’t do
nothin’ else but.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s awful, kid, but I can’t think what we saw
was real—<i>it couldn’t be</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But the mud on his shoes an’ his wet hair....”
Skippy argued.</p>

<p class='c008' >And when day dawned warm and clear, they had
come no nearer to the truth than that.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />WAITING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Devlin had a change of mind during the intervening
hours, and at breakfast he announced with
his usual gravity that they would not make the trip
that day after all. He had some important business
to attend to first, he said, and would leave them
alone that afternoon. On Monday evening they
would go.</p>

<p class='c008' >He seemed not at all concerned about the attic
but just before he was leaving that afternoon, he
started to remove the ladder.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, leave it there, won’t you?” Skippy asked
imploringly. “Nickie an’ me, we get sick of the
dark rooms downstairs an’ up there we can play
cards an’ all without a light. Gee whiz....”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy won.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin’s cold, staring eyes glittered more than
ever after he gave his consent and there was a calm
about him when he went out that left the boys perplexed.</p>

<p class='c008' >They rushed to the window when they heard him
slam the metal door of the woodshed. Eagerly
they watched while he stalked with measured steps
toward the barn. Then they saw him backing out
slowly in a blue coupe that was distinctly second-hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Another car!” Nickie gasped.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, I expected it, an’ I didn’t!” was Skippy’s
comment. “Did we hear Timmy say that old
sedan went over into the lake, or didn’t we?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We did <i>and how</i>! You’re right, kid, it looks
like I’m goofey about that spook stuff. We won’t
argue about it no more. What we gonna do all
day, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Work on those bars,” Skippy grinned. “Gee
whiz, Nick, tell the truth, I didn’t think we’d have
the chance. I thought he had us where he wanted.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Seven hours later, they were not so sure but that
Devlin would be triumphant after all. They had
worked sedulously during that time but there was
only a little give in the top bar and the boys were
well nigh discouraged.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sitting atop the trunk they surveyed the bars ruefully.
Another day was drawing to its close, another
day that brought them nearer to the Fate
which only Devlin held the key to. Skippy felt
weary and sick.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There’s no use, I guess, Nick. It’s comin’ out
like Timmy said—we can’t do a thing till he takes
us outa here for our turn.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, then we gotta use our beans an’ scram.
But it’s got <i>me</i>, kid; we saw in that book how much
money he expects from us. How can he get it when
we’re dead?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I dunno. We ain’t gonna hash this mystery
business all over again—I’m too blamed tired. All
I’m sure of is that Devlin gets money for us an’
sometime or other he’ll wanta kill us for some
reason. Timmy said it was a trick about him shippin’
us west, so that’s the night he does it—always
at night, you know that. When that night comes
for us, we just gotta outguess him.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“An’ it’s about a month from the time he takes
us to a sawbones,” Nickie said mournfully. “Well,
if we can’t do nothin’ else about it, I’m gonna pull
myself together. But one thing, I hope he takes us
together—see. If you go first or I go—holy
smoke, I can’t stand it if he takes us separate. I’m
scared I’ll lose my nerve—you know it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Forget it, Nick. Whatever he does, be foxy
an’ forget about me n’ I’ll do the same. Gee whiz,
from what Timmy said he don’t tie you down—if he
did that we wouldn’t have a chance. Now quit
worryin’, an’ let’s get down before he comes. I’ll
hide the things again an’ maybe he’ll be out a lotta
the time an’ we can try it again. If we keep pullin’
on them bars we’ll weaken ’em after awhile even if
it’s weeks.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, weeks too late.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie’s spirits rose considerably a little later.
Devlin had come in with a pail of chicken fricassee
and an apple pie, announcing that he had stopped
at a lunch wagon to give the boys a treat. Skippy
almost decided that all his suspicions had been unfounded.</p>

<p class='c008' >The problem was a tormenting one. Could anyone
be so cruel? Devlin’s face, always a study, was
no nearer revealing what lay behind his grave features
than on the day they had first seen him. Just
now he was as much absorbed in the chicken fricassee
as the boys were.</p>

<p class='c008' >A full stomach does much toward comforting the
harassed human being, and Nickie was no exception
to the rule. The keen look of defiance came back
into his eyes and he settled back in his chair, quite
forgetting for the time that the man who had so
generously fed him, was the man whom he had expected
would kill him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy’s full stomach, while giving him much
comfort, did not disarm him completely. He sat
back in his chair, noting Nickie’s peaceful face beside
him and Devlin’s mask-like countenance across
the table. Someone had to be ready and on guard—Devlin
had a price for everything—even chicken
fricassee.</p>

<p class='c008' >It came sooner than he expected. Devlin was
finishing his pie and washing it down with great
draughts of coffee. “Well, boys,” he said, genially,
“I suppose both of you swim, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy kicked Fallon under the table and said,
“Nope, not a stroke—neither of us. Do we,
Nick?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nah. Ain’t it a shame, hah? We oughta.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, yes. It’s something every boy ought to
know.” Devlin got up and his bulk seemed greater
than ever. His face had resumed its thoughtful
expression and the glitter had returned to his eyes.
“Well, I’ll be going up now—a little business I got
to attend to. If you boys wash up the dishes you can
have a game of cards before bedtime, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >They listened as he walked through the hall and
up the stairs. Skippy waited until he heard the
man’s step in his own room before he said, “Well,
he’s begun workin’ on us all right, an’ I trumped
his ace right off the bat.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How, kid?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“He expected us to say we could swim.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How did....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“’cause I’m layin’ for him all the time from
now on. Whatever he expected to do if we’d said
yes, I don’t know. But I know, he’s aimin’ to try
the car trick on us an’ he wanted to make sure
things wouldn’t go wrong. He can’t afford to have
us not drown when he’s countin’ on it, can he?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie put his elbows on the table and cupped his
chin. “You mean we gotta go through with it an’
take the chance that he can’t kill us ’cause we can
swim?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“If there ain’t any other chance, we gotta.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, I’m licked!” Nickie said hopelessly.</p>

<p class='c008' >But he wasn’t ... not yet....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />A PASSING FACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Distrustful though they were and full of nameless
fears, they stepped into Devlin’s coupé early
on Monday evening with a feeling of relief. To be
out in the air again, a part of the moving, restless
world—it gave them no small thrill and they tried
to put out of their minds all that had troubled them
since their strange imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin, adept at using either hand, dexterously
managed the car with his left hand and kept his
right hand significantly at his pocket. “I might as
well warn you boys,” he said when they had left the
clearing, “that I’ll stand for no nonsense. I got a
silencer on this gun in my pocket and it won’t make
any noise if either one of you try to beat it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie seemed to have been silenced without the
gun, but Skippy said, “Aw, don’t worry, mister.
Why should we beat it when you’re gonna ship us
out west an’ everything, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m glad you feel that way,” the man said
gravely, but watching the boys out of the corner
of his eye. “Timmy got very restless waiting
around and I had an idea he was putting notions in
your heads.” He coughed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, no,” Skippy said with a gulp. “I—er—he
didn’t say nothin’.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin did not relax. “I might as well tell you
my plans now,” he said slowly. “I’m taking you
both to a country doctor not far from here for a
physical examination. You are to act as if you
didn’t know where you were born or much of anything
else—understand? You may answer yes and
no to any questions he asks you but that is all. I’ll
do the rest of the talking. And you’re my sons—my
sons! Don’t forget that for a moment. I’ll be
watching every minute.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They rode through the woods path, turning here
and there so that Skippy could not keep track of
the route. Dusk was rapidly approaching and
when Devlin slowed down the car as they came
abreast of a narrow path, he could just about make
it out.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin stopped the car and got out backwards.
Then, reaching in the pocket flap of the coupé door,
he drew out a searchlight and played it up and
down the boggy-looking path for a flashing second,
yet giving Skippy plenty of time to notice several
large footprints on both sides of the trail.</p>

<p class='c008' >He said nothing to Nickie for Devlin was back
in the car again in a moment and they had started
off. A few feet farther on they crossed a tiny
wooden bridge of amateur construction.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Frost and me fixed that up,” said the man as
they rattled over the logs. He coughed again.
“Part bog and part creek and about fifteen feet
deep where we put the logs. Nasty place. Folks
around here don’t know anything about it any more—their
grandfolks and great-grandfolks that did
have forgot about it now.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They came at last to a road that had once
boasted asphalt and Skippy guessed that it had
taken them at least an hour to reach it. Along this
they speeded silently, each one wrapped in his own
thoughts. Not a car did they meet, not a person
or house did they pass and it was fully two hours
after they had left the dismal house when they
espied a small, lighted dwelling by the roadside.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin drove past that, too, and presently he
turned on to another badly paved road which took
them uphill. Skippy noticed the dark outline of
mountains spreading out around them. It was true
then, he thought, the house was situated in the
center of swamplands and forest. But where—where
were they?</p>

<p class='c008' >Another half hour’s ride and they came into a
small village, boasting a few stores and not more
than twenty-five houses. It was at the extreme end
of this quiet community and a little around the bend
that Devlin brought the car to a stop.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here we are,” he said, backing out as soon as
he had turned off his switch. “Now remember—leave
the talking to me!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy felt the gun at his back all the way up
the graveled walk. Nickie kept safely ahead and
walked with short, jerky steps. They went up on
the porch and a pleasant-faced lady answered the
doorbell.</p>

<p class='c008' >She led them into the sitting room at Devlin’s
deep-voiced request, and then disappeared. Then
the doctor appeared, a short, near-sighted little
man who talked in nasal accents and put his stethoscope
to Skippy’s rapidly beating heart with professional
alacrity.</p>

<p class='c008' >“So you got here, eh,” he said, as he changed the
instrument about on the boy’s chest. “Mr. Smithson
told me you’d come. Name’s Barker, eh?
Well, must say you’re a sensible man to watch out
what’s ahead. Guess both boys’ll pass muster. So
you’re starting a mushroom place down at Devil’s
Bog, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, yes,” Devlin answered, standing in a nonchalant
posture near the door. “Know much
about it, doc?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, nothing, except that it’s full of malaria and
mosquitoes and a dangerous place to go unless a
body knows where they’re going,” the garrulous
man answered. “I’ve never been there—guess your
place is quite a ways in, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mm,” Devlin answered. “Beggars can’t be
choosers, doc. I got to do the best I can for my
boys.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The doctor snorted. “Guess that’s so. Sometimes
they don’t thank a body any.” He had disposed
of Skippy by that time and nodded to Nickie.
“Just keep your eye on ’em, that’s all you can do.”
Then: “Did you say they’re going to help you?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mm, I’m too poor to get anyone else.”</p>

<p class='c008' >And that was all. The doctor dismissed them,
saying he had to get out on a call and before Skippy
could think what to do, they were out on the porch
and the door had closed behind them. Nickie
looked at his friend, desperately.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy sat down on the bottom step and began to
untie his shoe. “Something’s hurtin’ my foot,
mister,” he said innocently, as Devlin stood above him,
tall and questioning. “Guess it’s the lining—wait
a minute!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin walked a few feet away, standing in an
advantageous position while his staring eyes darted
from one boy to the other. Then, impatiently, he
walked on to the car. “I’m watching you, kid—hurry!”
he said, after curtly ordering Nickie inside.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy got his shoe back on and began to saunter
slowly down the walk, when suddenly he saw someone
turn in at the path. His heart jumped! It
was a lady and from under her hat the boy could
see white hair. God had sent her!</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m waiting, kid!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin’s voice was icy. Skippy had to think
quickly and, consequently, there was a sharp contact,
the lady’s pocketbook fell to the ground and
its contents fell out on the walk.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was nothing if not gallant. He was on
his knees, picking up the scattered articles and
cramming them back despite her sweet-voiced protests.
But he had to do it quickly, expertly, for
Devlin had a challenging look in his cold eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then he ran to the car and Nickie gave him an
anxious look. “Sorry I hadda keep you waitin’,
mister,” he said naïvely, “but that lady was old an’
she couldn’t stoop so well so I ...”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Come on, get in!” was Devlin’s response.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy looked back and saw that the old lady
stood holding her pocketbook tightly, watching
them as they drove away. Then she went up the
walk to the doctor’s house.</p>

<p class='c008' >After they had gone a few feet, Devlin backed
the car around and went back the way they had
come. As they drove down the brightly lighted
street of the little community, they came abreast of
a car which as Skippy had already noticed bore a
New York license plate. Even while he looked, a
face at one of the opened windows drew his attention,
a brisk face so pleasantly familiar.</p>

<p class='c008' >Dick Hallam!</p>

<p class='c008' >He tried to stifle his cry of surprise, but Devlin
had not missed it. “You know the man in that
car?” He had already stepped on the gas and
they were plunging forward with terrific speed.
“You know him?” he asked, insistently, threateningly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Y—yes.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy saw the headlights looming up from the
rear. Dick Hallam was giving chase. He had
seen him! Devlin, on the other hand, was not dismayed.
He was using all the speed of which the
car was capable and had turned off all except his
parking lights. Suddenly he swerved into a narrow
road and after that they made so many turns
that Skippy lost all sense of direction.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Devlin slowed down he coughed with
satisfaction. “I’m glad to see that neither of you
tried to pull a fast one. I had made up my mind
that I’d wreck the car if you did—I’m that way,
boys.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, we can see that,” Nickie said, with no
conscious attempt to be humorous. “You needn’t
a’ worried bout me, Devlin—I wouldn’t a’ laid a
hand on you. The shave was close enough the way
this car was goin’.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy had barely heard anything that was said.
He could think only that Dick Hallam had been
near enough to touch not a half hour back, and
now the night, and perhaps Death itself, separated
them. Certainly, it was too much to hope that
Hallam should find them now or ever!</p>

<p class='c008' >The doctor had said that no one knew of Devil’s
Bog. Why hadn’t he known the name of the place
before? Neither Carlton Conne nor his men
would ever find the place from his poor description
of it. And yet, he thought, did not the desolate
swampland stand out from all other swamplands?
Somehow, it did.</p>

<p class='c008' >And Dean Devlin, known or unknown, made it
stand out still more.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >They talked it all over before they went to sleep
that night and concluded that one bright star of
hope burned brightly in their favor. Everything
indicated that Devlin meant to get them both off his
hands at once. Nickie observed that perhaps Frost
had put the idea in his head and, if so, they had
much for which to thank him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy’s thoughts were full of Dick Hallam and
he dared to think there might be some hope in that
direction. Might not Hallam guess that Devlin
was holding him prisoner somewhere in the locality?
Might not Carlton Conne send out his men to scour
the countryside until they trailed down the forgotten
house that lay in the fastnesses of Devil’s
Bog?</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s gotta!” Skippy said aloud.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hah?” Nickie asked sleepily.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I was tellin’ myself that sump’n’s gotta come our
way. That guy we passed—I know him. He’ll
use his head that we must be some place nearby an’
he’ll have a hunt started for us.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, but we’re a coupla hours’ ride from where
the sawbones lives.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s called Hillbriar—I seen it on a sign.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, and this place—<i>Devil’s Bog</i>! That’s a
swell monicker all right. It’s the right place for
Devlin all right. If the <i>n</i> was out an’ the <i>i</i> put before
the <i>l</i> they could call him The Devil of Devil’s
Bog, hah? Say, the more I think the worse headache
I get about that doctor business. He ain’t in
on Devlin’s racket, that’s a cinch. If only Devlin
didn’t pack that rod, kid, we coulda spilled things.
But he was watchin’ us close, the dirty rat.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an’ I wasn’t gonna take no chance neither.
Gee whiz, Nickie, we’re better off waitin’ ’cause it’s
better bein’ alive than go off the handle an’ have
maybe three of us dead. Then he coulda skipped
out an’ nobody woulda heard a shot.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, we didn’t have no chance without gettin’
blowed up. Even in the car, that rat wasn’t missin’
no tricks. A coupla times I was gonna give you a
sign, ’cause I thought between us, we could land
on him, but he had that silencer right in his mitt.
He ain’t got no feelin’s, he makes me thinka rock
with icy water tricklin’ down it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did you notice anythin’ just before we come to
the creek, Nickie? I mean when he stopped an’
got out with his flash?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie lifted himself up on his elbow. “Say,”
he whispered, “them footsteps? Say, I was wonderin’
too. What was in there that he was so nosey
about, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wish I knew, believe me. That path I betcha
goes through the woods an’ down to that bog. He
said, didn’t he, that the creek an’ the bog both
wound round that way, huh? Anyway, it’s a cinch
that he was down that path Saturday night. We
seen mud on his feet an’ tonight we could see his
footsteps.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then it looks like he took Timmy for ...”
Nickie whispered fearfully.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I been thinkin’ the same thing. Gee whiz,
Nickie, it’s awful, huh? He’s like you say—a
devil! We gotta be pretty foxy with a feller like
that. He ain’t afraida nothin’, I don’t think.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, an’ don’t think we can beat him to it.
Lissen, kid, he’s twice our size an’ the gun he carries
ain’t no water pistol. It looks like if he don’t get
us one way, he’ll get us the other. Kid, the only
way we’ll get a break is for your friends to round
up the dicks an’ come down here and surprise
Devlin. An’ how can that happen when they don’t
know....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But maybe they will, Nickie,” Skippy whispered
hopefully. “I didn’t know the name of this place
when I wrote that note. Even I didn’t have a
chance to hardly get it outa my shoe so I wouldn’t
a’ had a chance....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“An’ that old lady,” Nickie interposed ruefully.
“Holy Smoke, kid, what a chance that was to slip
her that note if Devlin hadn’t kep’ watchin’ every
move. Just the kinda old lady we was talkin’ about
too.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What you talkin’ about, Nickie, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That note what you was gonna slip the first old
lady you could—remember? An’ you’d a’ had a
swell break if it wasn’t for Devlin. He’s a hoodoo
with that funeral pan o’ his.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee whiz, Nickie, did I get away with it as swell
as that? Gosh, I was scared skinny that maybe
Devlin was wise I knocked her pocketbook outa her
hand on purpose. <i>She</i> didn’t know I did it on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“On purpose—how come?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, I thought you knew it, Nickie. Gee whiz,
was that a break that it opened up an’ her stuff ran
all over the walk! When I give it back that note
was inside.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Kid, that’s the pay-off! If that ain’t a break.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, I did an’ how! By now I bet she’s read
that an’ maybe already she’s put it in an envelope
an’ it’s on the way to New York.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy would not have been able to endure the
anxiety of the following days if he had not had faith
that the note was well on its way. Hope would
soon have fled if he had known that the sweet-voiced
old lady had not discovered the note that night, nor
for many nights to come. She had gone home after
her visit to the doctor and, being confined to her
bed for the next two weeks with a bad cold, there
had been no occasion to use her “best” pocketbook.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin seemed destined to win.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />ACCUSATIONS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Their hopes flared high, then burned so low
that they were beginning to exchange whispers of
despair. When a week had passed, then ten days,
they looked at each other hopelessly and each knew
what was in the other’s thoughts without the exchange
of a word. Timmy’s “nerves” had been
nothing compared to Nickie’s “jumpiness,” as he
called it. He fairly quailed whenever Devlin’s
footsteps sounded.</p>

<p class='c008' >The man kept to his own room, except for three
consecutive days when he left the house just before
dusk and returned late at night. At those times,
the boys hurried to the attic and fell to work at the
window bars, only to realize at the end of the week,
that it would take more than their inadequate little
pot handle to gain freedom.</p>

<p class='c008' >On Wednesday of the following week, Devlin
was plainly angry. The boys knew he was thinking
of Frost and they seemed to sense that the man’s
unexpected departure was enraging Devlin more
and more. He paced the length of the house, muttering
to himself and clenching his big hands until
his knuckles cracked. This continued throughout
the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c008' >Supper was a disappointment as all the meals had
been. Devlin had not again been so generous as to
surprise them with any more of the lunchroom
delicacies such as he had brought in on that Sunday
night. Meal after meal was the same, a monotony
of canned beans, bacon and crackers.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy had no appetite that night. The smell of
bacon made him sick and he felt that never again
in his life would he be able to eat it. Nickie moped
dejectedly over his plate and when he did put anything
to his mouth he washed it down quickly with
coffee as if he dared not taste it.</p>

<p class='c008' >He looked at Skippy and shook his head. “If
there’s two more weeks like this, kid, you’ll need
your strength—see. I’m sick, too, but I feel I gotta
eat no matter what, so I wash every mouthful down
with this rotten coffee. No matter how rotten
coffee is, it’s better’n tastin’ them blamed beans and
bacon.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was trying out this sound advice when
they heard the familiar sound of a car chugging
into the clearing. Nickie put down his coffee cup
with a bang and before either one of them could
make any comment, they heard Devlin rushing out
of his room and down the stairway.</p>

<p class='c008' >He came loping into the kitchen muttering,
“Frost—it’s Frost,” and rushed to one of the windows
and looked out.</p>

<p class='c008' >The boys were at the other window in a second
and though the evening shadows were lengthening,
they could see the big, dark car rolling into the
barn. They watched as Frost came out with his
short, hopping stride, and they heard Devlin mumble
deep in his throat.</p>

<p class='c008' >The man made no attempt to go near the door
but stood back against the wall and waited. The
boys went back to the table and made a pretense of
drinking their coffee. All the time, however, they
too were waiting and they listened intently as
Frost’s key clinked against the metal door.</p>

<p class='c008' >Abruptly his leathern-looking face appeared in
the doorway wreathed in smiles. “Howdy!” he
was saying breezily. “How——” He caught the
insane glint in Devlin’s eyes and stood suddenly
still. “Say, you don’t look glad to see me, boss!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did you expect me to?” Devlin’s voice boomed
through the room.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost flushed up to the roots of his colorless hair.
His small, shifty eyes strayed toward the boys, then
back to Devlin again. “Oh, if you feel that way
about it—I was thinkin’ I was helpin’ you out—givin’
you a hand....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Since when did I ask you to do my thinking for
me, eh? Since when did you give me a hand without
being told to?” There was a ring in Devlin’s
voice that made his listeners quiver when he added,
“Come upstairs—I’ve got plenty to say to you!”</p>

<p class='c008' >The boys had never had any doubt that Devlin
was a man of his word. Now they were learning
that he went far beyond that and gave no quarter
to anyone who had taken too much for granted at
his expense. And from the terrible wrath with
which Devlin shook the house, Frost must have
been aware that he had committed the unforgivable
sin in the eyes of his nefarious employer.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin seemed to have thrown aside all caution in
his anger. His solemn, terrible voice trailed down
the stairs to where the boys were standing, absorbing
it all. Frost, at first, had made a feeble protest,
but was soon forced to stand back and listen.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Boss,” he had said, obsequiously, “there ain’t no
use gettin’ sore when I only meant to help out.
Anyways, it seemed like wastin’ time stayin’ here
and....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Shut up!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin’s long, determined stride shook the floor
with each step he took. “I didn’t make up my
mind what to do about those infernal Greek kids.
And I had that pest Timmy on my hands while
you....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Didn’t things blow right, Boss?” Frost’s voice
sounded conciliatory.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin shouted, “Don’t remind me of it! I tell
you it looks like luck is turning against me. First
with Tucker out in Chi and now Timmy—I tell you
they’re a dead loss! Then I come in here Saturday
night almost dead, I’m so tired, and what do I find!
You gone on your own hook with the two Greeks—after
me telling you to stay here!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But, Boss—I did the job without no trouble
and....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“With that grinning face of yours I suppose you
could look the part, eh? Only I’ve got the face
for this business—people don’t get wise to a face
like mine—they think I’m drowning in grief. But
<i>you</i>—I wasn’t going to let you go through with the
Greeks; either one of ’em. I decided that when I
was fooled by that pest of a Timmy. It’s risky
enough for me without you going ahead and doing
things on your own. It shows what brains you’ve
got when you couldn’t even wait the month at
least.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost became sullen and defiant at this challenge.
“Oh, yeah?” he parried. “Well, let me tell <i>you</i>
somethin’, Boss. I was goin’ to tell you when I
come in but you ain’t give me a chance to get a word
in—I had brains to wait a month all right, but
somethin’ happened. We got a room and I passed
the word around we was looking for jobs like you
work it. I even give the landlady such a sob story
she gives me the dope herself that we ought to get
our names on the dotted line so it was soft.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How much?” Devlin inquired almost eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“A grand each!” came the proud reply. “I
made the agent talk me into that—he said a thousand
when I said five hundred.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Go on!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I made the first payment Friday, and Saturday
morning we went out after dawn for a fishing trip—not
a phoney one, Boss—I meant it real ’cause I
wanted the low down on how I’d work it when the
time was ripe. I knew by then they couldn’t swim,
but like I say it was a try-out. It was a hazy
morning and the water was rough and we hadn’t
got far out when that Shorty stands up in the boat
to pass something to Biff. Next thing I know we
was in the water and the Greeks was shoutin’ their
heads off and the tide was pushin’ me down-stream
like anything. I couldn’t swim against it and I was
lucky to grab the end of the boat that was floatin’
upside down. Anyway, a guy fishin’ in near shore
hears the racket and comes out. But the Greeks
had got it and he was lucky to help me.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did they find ’em?” Devlin’s question was
eager.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, and say, wasn’t I plastered with sympathy
at that boardin’ house! Things just blew my way.
I won’t have no trouble gettin’ the money. In
three weeks I’m going back and collect. I told ’em
out there that I was comin’ East to look for work
’cause the trouble didn’t make Pittsburgh look so
good to me.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s better, Frost—I didn’t think you had it
in you. Those two downstairs will be off my hands
by that time—I’ll go out with you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wouldn’t take no chances if I was you, Boss.
I got today’s papers in the car. They’re playin’ up
on the Delafield kids and they hinted there was a
racket behind it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>What?</i>” Devlin’s heavy foot pounded on the
floor.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” Frost answered as if he were almost enjoying
the telling of it, “one paper says the dicks
are hep and some famous detective has promised to
run down the brains of it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Carlton Conne!</i>” was all Devlin said.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s what I thought right away. You know
that guy, Boss, so I’d lay off a little. You might
get jammed in Pittsburgh. I can collect them two
G’s all right.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I realize that, Frost,” said Devlin coldly. “But
trouble or no trouble, I’m going to go to Pittsburgh
with <i>you—understand</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The boys could not hear Frost’s reply. He
might not have voiced his opinion at all. But
Devlin’s heavy steps overhead seemed to speak
volumes. Suddenly he hurled a question that made
Skippy’s heart stand still.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Frost,” he was shouting, “where’s that memorandum
book of mine, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The boys sprang into the kitchen. They closed
the door noiselessly behind them and sat down,
stunned and hopeless looking.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, it’s come, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy nodded. “Gee whiz, I did forget. We
just gotta deny it like we planned.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, but that ain’t sayin’ Devlin’s gonna believe
us, kid.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy leaned forward on the table, his eyes
blinking thoughtfully. “Listen, Nickie, it don’t
make no difference what he believe, does it? If
we don’t get help, we’ll have to go with him an’
take the chance like we planned. So we should
worry about it either way.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was right. Worrying about it wouldn’t
help. Devlin and Frost came downstairs a few
minutes later and accused them, but they managed
to stick to their guns. That they had taken the
ladder seemed to have caused no suspicion; neither
had the boys’ frequent trips to the attic revealed
how desperate had been their efforts to loosen the
bars. Devlin seemed not to have noticed it.</p>

<p class='c008' >His mind was on the notebook and his face
showed that he would not dismiss the topic easily.
“Where is it?” he was saying.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, mister, what do we want with a darn old
notebook anyway!” Skippy retorted. “Search us—search
our whole room but you won’t find it,
’cause what would we want with it, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s what I’d like to know,” Devlin said,
narrowing his eyes. He turned to Nickie, “I think
you picked that lock—what for?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, pipe down. Even if I did—what about it,
hah? You can see that we didn’t take anything an’
if we had, what could we do with it? I guess you
ain’t worried that we got any money or anything
like that, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hear that, Frost? I guess they’re telling the
truth and that puts it up to you. You trying to
double cross me?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, I ain’t that dumb, Boss,” Frost protested.
“Maybe you mislaid it or lost it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Maybe—and maybe not.” Then Devlin turned
on his heel and left the room with Frost hopping
after him protesting his innocence. But it was evident
to the boys that Devlin suspected Frost for the
dour looking leader returned soon muttering: “I’ll
get him yet.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />THE MICE WILL PLAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >It was apparent next day that relations were
strained between the two men. Frost went about
looking sullen and defiant and Devlin, when he was
not up in his room sleeping, sat in the kitchen drinking
coffee with ominous gravity.</p>

<p class='c008' >Late afternoon came and Devlin appeared
dressed to go out. He strode about the kitchen
several times, then walked to the door. Frost
eyed him curiously.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Goin’ out, Boss?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin looked back and nodded. “I’ll be back
early tonight.” He glanced at the boys. “You
be ready to take a ride with Frost and me.”</p>

<p class='c008' >He slammed the door and Nickie paled, noticeably.
Frost sat idly at the table drumming his
thick fingers upon the oilcloth cover. Skippy went
to the window and watched until Devlin backed the
big car out. Then he turned suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, mister,” he said to Frost, “me an’ Nickie
know what Devlin’ll take us on a ride for tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008' >If Frost was surprised he did not show it. He
glanced up at Skippy. “So you’re a wise kid, hey?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nope, we just kept our ears open last night an’
heard plenty. Devlin talked loud enough so we
put two and two together. Anyhow we know
Timmy never went out West—we know he’s dead.
Tucker got picked up in Chicago an’ that put the
bulls wise Devlin was in a new racket.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost was aghast. “How do you—you....”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy put his cards on the table. “I know
everthin’ now, I do, an’ I knew plenty before I ever
seen Devlin. We’ll give you a break if you let us
get away tonight. If you don’t Devlin’ll go to
Pittsburgh with you an’ grab that dough—a blind
guy could see he figures you’re givin’ him the
double-x—an’ besides I heard him say he’d get you.
Anyhow I know the cops’ll grab him there an’ if
you’re with him you’ll be grabbed, too. So chaw
on that a bit.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost was plainly frightened. “He’s been actin’
so crazy lately he might take me for a ride at that
and if I get grabbed with him I’ll get the hot squat
too.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy used the best thrust he knew. “Sure, you
will. The cops got that notebook right now—anyway
if they ain’t, Carlton Conne’s got it an’ that’s
as good as with the cops.” He waited a moment
until that shot had found its mark and then he
added: “I sent Carlton Conne a note an’ that notebook
too the night Devlin took us to the doctor’s
house—I told him how long it was from the time
we had the accident an’ all about this house an’
what the hermit told you. So if you know anything
about Carlton Conne you know he’ll find this
joint sooner or later an’ if Nickie an’ me are dead,
it’ll be tough for you if you’re found with Devlin.
Now I’ll give you a break if you’ll give us one.
How ’bout it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Like many of his ilk, Frost thought only of his
own safety and as he had neither brains nor cunning,
he did not stop to question nor consider anything
but himself.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, I’ll give you kids a break—<i>sure</i>!” he was
crying like the yellow creature he was. “You think
I wanta burn with Devlin when I ain’t done nothin’
yet but help kids for him, hey? I met him in Chi
and he brought me here and propositioned me.
But I ain’t never tried the trick on any kids and
them Greeks if they didn’t get drowned like they
did, I couldn’t gone through with it—I know it. I
got more feelin’s than Devlin, but I hadda stick
and play up—get me? I come along in a car that
night I see him first and saw him ship that Tucker
kid over that cliff into the lake. I’d made a
stick-up a few minutes before and I was makin’ my
getaway without lights.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“An’ you seen what he did?” Skippy asked
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure. He didn’t hear me and he didn’t see me
so I switched off under some trees and it was a
lonesome road that hardly anybody traveled between
midnight and morning. I see an old car stop
and this guy gets out. It’s Devlin. Then you
could have knocked me over when I sees him give
the little car a shove right over the cliff. So me
bein’ in a little racket myself I puts on my lights
and chugs up to him and he waves me to stop. So
he gives me a story that him and his son was ridin’
along and the car stalls. He gets out to crank
it while his son gets behind the wheel to fix the
spark. Well, the brake mustn’t been on, he tells
me, when all of a sudden he sees the car headed
right over the cliff to the lake. He just has time to
jump out of the way, he says.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Such a warm-hearted guy he is!” Nickie said
disgustedly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, he ain’t got no heart,” Frost said, with
more composure. “But to make it quick, I tell him
I’m wise and what’s his racket. So we get real
chummy and he tells me to drive on and when we
do he says it’s insurance that he’s working.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Insurance!</i>” Skippy repeated as if he must never
forget the word.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, he tells me it’s a good payin’ racket. He
says he can get orphans so they don’t have no real
near folks inquirin’ after ’em. He can get ’em insured
and wait a month or so, then he can take ’em
out in a car, an old closed car he likes to get that
don’t cost him more’n a few bucks—you know, the
kind that’s ready for the junk yard. If they can
swim he can dope ’em a little with some stuff he’s
got so by the time they get where he wants, all he
has to do is to get out and push the car over to the
water.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“So that’s how he worked it, huh?” Skippy asked,
feeling rather sick.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure,” Frost answered readily. “If they can’t
swim, he likes it better. Then he uses that stallin’
business to get out, leavin’ off the brake. He
thought he had Tucker sure, but the kid comes to
and gets out in time so Devlin thinks he don’t give
him enough dope.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie shuddered visibly. “So he reports it an
accident?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, and with that funeral face Devlin gets
away with it. When the whole business is over he
collects the insurance.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee whiz!” Skippy murmured. “<i>It’s awful!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, don’t think I liked it when he told me!”
Frost said, on the defensive. “But he told me I
wouldn’t have to do no part of that. He said all
I had to do was the details like he called it. So
what could I do when he had told me all that and
asked me to come in on it with him? He’d have
put me on the spot for what I knew about him if I
didn’t. Besides, he said it was goin’ to be safe
and that he’d worked it out so’s we couldn’t get
caught.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why didn’t you stay in Pittsburgh?” Skippy
asked suddenly. “You wanted to, I betcha.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, I did. But he’da found me—if it was
years he’d find me so I thought I’d better come
back.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You can go back to Pittsburgh tonight if you
help us get away. You can start back now—the
coupe’s out in the barn, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, but he might...” Frost began.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tell him you took us out for the air an’ we
beat it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie was aroused, jubilant at the new turn of
events. “Yeah, an’ say, Frost, tell him you chased
us down in the woods where the bog gets tough, but
that we give you the slip there, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s the stunt, Mister Frost. And tell him
you’ll hunt us on one side while he hunts on the
other. Then, when he’s gone, you beat it fast,
’cause we’ll have the cops in here after him by that
time. He can’t chase you to Pittsburgh when he’s
in jail, can he?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost fell as Skippy afterward termed it, “hook,
line and sinker.” “Sounds like it’s fool-proof,
kids,” he said. “And the dicks don’t know about
me, hey?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How would they?” Skippy assured him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost got up. “I’ll get my keys,” he said, “and
we’ll beat it pronto. I’ll take you to the highway
and make out I won’t be glad to beat it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie looked at Skippy while they were waiting.
“It ain’t true you sent that notebook, is it?”
he asked incredulously.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy grinned. “Gee, <i>you’re</i> not fool-proof,
Nickie. How could I get that book without Devlin
seein’ me that night, huh? Didn’t I have a big
enough job on my hands gettin’ that note into the
old lady’s pocketbook? I hadda spread it on thick
to frighten him right off an’ make him think the
cops had that book—well, it ain’t a lie exactly ’cause
they’ll have it some day an’, boy, is that enough to
send Devlin where he can’t be sent any more,
huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“An’ how!” Nickie agreed. “Then it’s still out
there behind the barrel, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, an’ it’s gonna stay there till the cops come
an’ get it. I’ll tell ’em where it is—nobody else
would think to look for it there. We can’t let
Frost see us takin’ it now an’ even if we could, I
don’t like it on us in case anythin’ goes wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, what could go wrong now, hah?” Nickie
said confidently. “Frost takes us out to the road
where we’re safe, so we should worry.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy felt somewhat less confident. He could
not, try as he would, put away from him the feeling
that nothing was sure in the dark, forgotten swampland
of Devil’s Bog. When they were once clear
of it entirely, he told himself, he would be able to
laugh at the fears which he felt now.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br />A SLIP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Frost drove away from the clearing with a confidence
that communicated itself to Nickie. He
was talkative, affable and even informative. Devlin,
he told them, had searched out the abandoned
house after his talk with the old hermit when they
had had a breakdown with their car some ten miles
from the bog. Their hunt hadn’t been an easy one—they
made the journey three times before they
found the place.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But the boss is that persistent,” the man was
saying. “He don’t give up. That’s why I ast you
kids to tell the dicks as soon’s you get out, ’cause if
he don’t find you by tonight, he’ll be hoppin’ off
after me.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did he tell you anything about poor Timmy,
huh?” Skippy asked. “Did he tell you that he
come back that night?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“He didn’t tell me nothin’ about him excep’ that
he had trouble,” Frost answered truthfully. “But
I know what you kids think about it—I think the
same thing. He said he could never go to Albany
and collect on Timmy so you know what that means
without me tellin’.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy couldn’t talk about it—it was all too
horrifying. Nickie must have felt the same way
for he was silent and his dark eyes kept to the narrow
woods trail as if he dared not look on either
side. Somewhere in that bog was Timmy, free
from Devlin at last.</p>

<p class='c008' >They rode along in silence after that and though
they were all a bit nervous they felt that courage
would come when a safe distance had been put between
them and the terrible house. Though Devlin
was not there in body he seemed to be there in
spirit, and they longed to get out of the woods and
into the open where he could no longer wield his
power.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was about five o’clock. Bits of warm sunshine
filtered through the higher branches of the trees
but below the shadows were gathering and where
the growth was thick a gloom had already penetrated.</p>

<p class='c008' >When they had been riding for some little time,
Frost said, “The boss is goin’ to see Smithson, the
insurance man, I think. He lives in Hillbriar near
that doctor you went to see. He must have some
place else to go, I been thinkin’, ’cause it wouldn’t
take him that long to just go there.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The boys were about to agree when they rounded
a turn in the narrow trail and saw just ahead the
path which Devlin had seemed so interested in on
that memorable Monday night. Also, they saw
Devlin sitting in his car as if he had just climbed
in and was ready to start away. He was headed
in the same direction that they were.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost swerved the car with such force that it
almost turned on its side. “Scram, kids!” he said
hoarsely. “I’ll have to too! He’ll know—he’ll
know I’m double-crossin’ him!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was out of the coupé with Nickie jumping
after him. They grasped hands instinctively, and
broke through the thick brush running blindly,
wildly, but running as they had never run before.
Devlin’s terrible voice seemed to follow them everywhere
for his shouts rang out time and again and
they heard Frost scream several times.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not once did they look back. They could hear
the crackling brush and they thought that Frost
must be somewhere in their wake. They thought
no more about the man than that for they were too
intent on their own preservation. They must not,
at any cost, stop until Devlin’s funereal echoes were
left far behind.</p>

<p class='c008' >Darkness had almost overtaken them before they
had the courage to sit down and rest on a fallen
log. Muddy and scratched from head to foot, they
would have presented a comical picture if it had
not been for the piteous expression on their faces.
Mosquitoes had already got in some of their work
as the great red lumps on their hands and foreheads
indicated.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We gotta slap mud on thick, Nickie,” Skippy
said wearily. “I read once about a kid what was
lost in a swamp and he did that and saves his life.
These blamed things can eat a feller up—you know
it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I feel like I’m ate up a’ready,” Nickie answered
pathetically. “Kid, you think we gotta stay in this
graveyard all night?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s night now an’ where are we? There’s no
use stumblin’ ’round in the dark, is there? We
might walk plunk into that bog an’ you heard yourself
what Frost said about it. You don’t get out
once you walk into some parts.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wonder where Frost is, hah? I don’t remember
when we stopped hearin’ him behind us. I
s’pose we oughta stopped, but honest, kid, I felt like
Devlin most had wings, his voice sounded so near
all the time.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Frost knows this place better’n we do. Gee
whiz, I wish he coulda kept up with us. But he
didn’t, so we gotta make the best of it. I’m ’fraid
to lie down in the mud, ain’t you, Nickie?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You said it, kid! The mosquitas’ll bite right
through our pants. Guess we’ll have to be like the
birds an’ roost in a tree all night, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, I was thinkin’ that too. Gee, we won’t
get much sleep—we <i>can’t</i> sleep, ’cause maybe we’ll
fall out!” Skippy yawned with exhaustion. “We
gotta take turns watchin’ each other.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They gave up that plan after a half-hour’s sentry
duty on two of the lower limbs of a poplar tree.
Not only were their positions uncomfortable, but
the mosquitoes annoyed them despite their masks of
mud. Then, too, an owl had taken up its position
in a nearby tree and hooted into the awful darkness
until they felt they could stand it no longer.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sounds like Devlin,” said the superstitious
Nickie. “Sounds like his spook.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“How can it be, if he ain’t dead?” Skippy whispered
back.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, ain’t my aunt told me that some guys is so
bad, they have infloo-ence on things ’round them?
Well, I heard owls near that house like you did, an’
how do you know Devlin didn’t put the bead on one
of ’em an’ make it just like he is?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Pretty soon you’ll be tellin’ me you believe in
imps an’ all that stuff in fairy stories,” Skippy said,
with a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, shut up!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was silent, for the owl had taken the stage
and drowned them out completely.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXX' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <br />DEVIL’S BOG</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Dawn finally came, and they waited anxiously
for the light to filter through the trees sufficiently
for them to be on their way. It was a disheartening
sight that the light disclosed, for nothing but
trees and swamp seemed to surround them and they
could see no road or trail.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy had been to the top of the tree, but it was
not high enough for a lookout. “There’s so many
other trees higher’n this, it can’t be done,” he said,
disappointed. “An’ how we gonna climb those
high trees when they can’t be climbed, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie shrugged his shoulders. “The next thing
we gotta think of is chow.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy grinned. “We got lots of mud—nothing
but. Gee whiz, I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s too bad we couldn’t ’a’ knocked off that
blamed owl, hah? We’d ’a’ got some sleep maybe
an’ we’d ’a’ had some breakfast on his fat neck.”</p>

<p class='c008' >They started off with high hopes. It was all a
chance, Skippy reasoned, and they hadn’t any idea
what direction would be best. The thing to do,
then, was to go and keep on going, trusting to luck
that they would come out somewhere.</p>

<p class='c008' >They wallowed through miles and miles of mud,
trying with long sticks each dubious looking stretch
of swamp in their path. Often they were forced to
turn back and circle great pools of silent black
water where on the thick green scum the thin rays
of sunlight smiled in derision.</p>

<p class='c008' >And then noonday arrived, with the sun hot and
mocking directly over the tops of the trees. Below
in Devil’s Bog was a steaming heat that seemed to
hiss out of the black, miry ground and every stir of
air soon lost its freshness in the dank smell of the
place.</p>

<p class='c008' >Toward mid-afternoon Nickie lost his head a
little. “S’pose we shouldn’t get out, kid?” he
cried. “S’pose we should go on like this for days—we’d
starve—we’d be eaten up with them mosquitoes
or somethin’.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy tried to laugh. “I’d rather be eaten up
with <i>somethin’</i>, Nickie—honest!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, I know, kid. Here, I’m older’n you—I
shouldn’t lose my head. Looks like I’m yeller,
hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Go on—it looks like you’re mud and so’m I.
Gee whiz, my aunt’d have a fit if she could see this
suit. She paid six bucks for it on a Hundred and
Twenty-fifth Street.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Holy Smoke, will we ever see a Hundred and
Twenty-fifth Street again! Kid, if we’d only
waited a little while longer, hah? Devlin had been
nosin’ in that bog since he left the house an’ we saw
he was on his way to Hillbriar. If we’d only
waited—the coast woulda been clear.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s the use thinkin’ about ‘if’? Gee whiz,
we’re here an’ that’s all there’s to it. Anyway, we
got each other. Poor Frost, in a way I feel kinda
sorry for him if he’s wand’rin’ ’round like us. It
must be terrible havin’ no buddy to talk to in a
place like this.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie was touched. “I didn’t think of it that
way, kid. I oughta be glad an’ I <i>am</i> glad. I’d
know somethin’ all right, all right, if I didn’ have
you. Didn’t I say it seemed like Fate you’n me
took such a shine to each other? Anyways, I felt
you was regular the minute you come in the car.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy looked at him. Somehow he hadn’t
thought about Nickie particularly—he had never
defined his feelings except that he knew he disliked
the boy that the old Nickie represented, the sullen,
defiant and lawless Nickie. But the new Nickie,
and there <i>was</i> a new one, walking and suffering beside
him; he was kind, thoughtful and best of all
loyal.</p>

<p class='c008' >He put his arm through Nickie’s. “I like you
the way you are now—you know it! An’ if you
stay that way—you know what I mean—cut out the
slippery stuff an’ do like your aunt wants you to, I
think mebbe Mr. Conne would stand your probation.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You mean he’d get me sprung?” Nickie asked,
incredulously.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If you’d promise to be like you are now an’
stick to it—that’s showin’ how much of a friend
you are, Nickie.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie stopped and put out his slim, muddy
hand. “There’s my mitt on it, pal!” he grinned.
Then he looked puzzled. “Say, how come you got
so much drag with Carlton Conne—that big dick,
hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >It was Skippy’s turn to grin. “Sump’n tells me
Mr. Conne would say it was all right for me to tell
<i>you</i>. Listen....”</p>

<p class='c008' >And Nickie listened, fascinated. They trudged
along arm in arm, digging into the mire before
them with their sticks and forgetting, as Skippy
talked, that they were weary and hungry and almost
despairing.</p>

<p class='c008' >The afternoon was waning when they noticed
that the trees were beginning to thin out ahead.
The underbrush was much less dense and therefore
they were able to walk faster despite the fact that
the ground was even more miry than any they had
yet encountered.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was beginning to feel a little hope. Were
they not almost out of the woods when the trees
thinned out like this? He had almost convinced
himself that they were, when he saw just before
him several large footsteps in the slimy ground.</p>

<p class='c008' >His finger trembled as he pointed to them.
“Look, Nickie!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie nodded his head slowly and whispered,
“Devlin’s!”</p>

<p class='c008' >They were standing there trying to decide
whether to run or not when they saw, still a little
farther on, a dark object lying on the ground.
There was something so significant about its size
and shape that a mutual horror of it impelled them
on, despite themselves.</p>

<p class='c008' >Frost was lying face downward in the mud.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy bit at his under lip to keep from shouting.
Nickie had grasped his arm and was shaking like
an aspen leaf. Suddenly, they heard a sound from
behind a tree not ten feet distant.</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin stepped out before they could move. He
was grave, unsmiling as ever and his eyes glittered
coldly. “Too bad, isn’t it,” he said enigmatically.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy could only gasp; Nickie could only shake.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s dangerous to run off in this bog,” Devlin
boomed in his funereal voice. “A person can meet
almost any kind of a death, as you see. You boys
might be lying there instead of Frost, eh? Well,
it’s lucky I found you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >It was too true—Devlin had found them!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <br />DOOMED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >They had neither heart nor voice to talk. Not
for hours. They seemed to have lived through
some terrible nightmare. From the moment when
they saw Devlin’s footprints the panorama had
moved before them, swiftly, relentlessly. And
now they were back again in the house of gloom
and terror.</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy sat in a daze as he watched Devlin talk.
“You can’t complain about me as a host,” he was
saying, “after you deliberately desert my generous
hospitality what do I do, eh? I bring you safely
back and now I’m inviting you to help yourself to
some supper. There’s plenty of bacon and beans!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, pipe down, Devlin!” Nickie shouted,
stung into action. “What you gonna do with us,
hah? That’s all we wanta know!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Devlin was calm, unruffled as ever. “I’ve got
something to attend to,” he said icily. “It can’t
wait. In fact, you interrupted the task by showing
up when you did. But now that I have you where
I know you’ll be safe, I’ll leave you for an hour or
two. You’re welcome to wash the mud from yourselves
and go to bed. I can assure you that you’ll
be quite safe <i>tonight</i>!” He coughed significantly.
“I’m leaving you boys with an easy mind—there’s
no Frost now to double-cross me! Goodnight!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy shivered until he was certain the man was
gone. Then he got up wearily and reached for the
coffee-pot. Nickie watched with some surprise.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You got the heart to eat, hah?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not the heart, Nick—just the stomach.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ugh! I’m sick, Skip—say, kid, ain’t it great
the way I just natural like call you Skippy, hah?
Just like I always knew it’s your name. I s’pose
he’s gonna put poor Frost where nobuddy’ll ever
find him, the same’s Timmy. Ugh, I’m sick all
through!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy went on with the making of the coffee,
mechanically. “I can’t understand ’bout the note,
Nickie,” he said for the hundredth time. “If Mr.
Conne got it they oughta been here—gee whiz, last
week. Even before.”</p>

<p class='c008' >And for the hundredth time Nickie said consolingly,
“The old lady mighta lost her pocketbook in
the river or sump’n, hah?” Then, after a pause:
“What a break for Frost just when he was doin’ us
a good turn! Ain’t that Fate, hah? Things just
ain’t right in this world.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Listen, Nick, it’s a shame about Frost an’ I’m
plenty thankful what he did for us—or what he
tried to do. But gee whiz, he hadn’t no lily-white
soul to team up with Devlin, did he? He was used
to rough stuff—a hold-up man, that’s what he was.
Well, he had a gun when he met Devlin an’ he
coulda made him go to the cops right that night.
Gee, Frost might not been’s heartless as Devlin, but
he stood for Devlin’s stuff. And that’s as bad.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie agreed. He had seemed to brighten up
during Skippy’s moral talk and was sniffing the air.
“Holy Smoke!” he exclaimed suddenly. “Even his
rotten coffee smells like food now.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy smiled wanly. “Thought you wasn’t
hungry. Thought you was sick?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Guess I ain’t, hah? Since I smelled that I wanta
eat.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Eat—that’s right. While we live we gotta eat—gee
whiz, what a life!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t talk like that, Skip. Just talk about
eatin’ while we can. I’ll open some beans an’ I’ll
fry some ba....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, <i>not bacon</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Meat’ll give us strength.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, all right. But believe <i>me</i>, this is the last
time in my life I’m gonna eat bacon!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie looked at him, frightened. Skippy knew
what he was thinking of—he thought it himself the
moment he had spoken those words. They seemed
full of dreadful portent now that they had been
uttered. Was it written that this was to be the
last time in his life when he would eat food of any
kind?</p>

<p class='c008' >Did it mean that they were doomed?</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic005'>

<p>THEY WERE FREE OF THE HOUSE SLIDING HAND OVER HAND ALONG THE ROPE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXII<br /> <br />ANOTHER DAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >They had reached a point where fear had no
longer the power to torture them for sleepless hours
on end. Long before Devlin returned they were
sleeping the sleep of exhaustion. Fortunately, they
did not hear his awesome step on the stairs nor did
they hear him linger outside their door and listen
to their deep, regular breathing before he went to
his room for the night.</p>

<p class='c008' >Day dawned and when the sun spread her roseate
glow across the eastern horizon, Skippy got up and
went on tiptoe to the window. He was amazed
that he was looking out through those dirty green
shutters on another day—he was amazed that Devlin
had not thought of some awful fate for them
before they had opened their eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >He looked out over the top of the rickety barn
and down across forest and bog. Crickets were
chirping lustily already and the sweet chorus of
rising birds filled the warm air. Then a crow
cawed overhead and in its wake Skippy heard
sounds that pulled at his heartstrings.</p>

<p class='c008' >A car!</p>

<p class='c008' >He listened again. It wasn’t Devlin’s big car
for he could see the rear of it parked in the barn.
What had become of the blue coupé, he did not
know. Was Frost’s ghost returning in that now?
He shivered and jeered at himself for absorbing
Nickie’s superstitions.</p>

<p class='c008' >He seemed to sense a hushed activity going on in
the clearing. His heart leaped inside his breast.
He couldn’t detect any particular sound—he felt
impelled to go to the front room which Shorty and
Biff had occupied and see if he could get a glimpse
of anything or anyone through those shutters.</p>

<p class='c008' >While he was thinking about it, he heard Devlin’s
heavy tread. The man came out into the hall and
dashed down the stairs. Instinctively, Skippy
rushed to the bed and awakened Nickie.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I feel it, Nick!” he was whispering excitedly.
“I feel it that sump’n’s gonna happen an’ that we
better get dressed.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie did not have to be told a second time—he
had great regard for Skippy’s hunches.</p>

<p class='c008' >When they had dressed quickly, they ran out into
the hall, but hesitated at the head of the stairs.
Devlin was standing down in the front hall, evidently
looking out through the small aperture in his
metal door and mumbling excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll not give up—<i>never</i>!” he was saying in deep,
wild tones. “Neither will they get those kids—I
won’t give ’em the satisfaction. I’ll burn the house
up and they’ll burn up with me, that’s what I’ll do!
I’ll show ’em—I’ll show ’em!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy put his fingers to his lips and beckoned
Nickie toward the rear of the hall. In a second
they were scrambling up the ladder and into the
attic. Then the ladder was pulled up after them
and the trap door slammed shut.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie was at his wit’s end, crying and gesticulating.
“If he lights up this dump, we’ll roast fine up
here. What’s the idea, hah—what’s the idea?
That guy must be cuckoo.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll take a chance on him burnin’,” Skippy said,
running toward the front window, “but he ain’t
gonna use that silencer on me!”</p>

<p class='c008' >He paused at the window and gasped. The
clearing was full of men—he couldn’t seem to count
them. Men in uniform, men without uniform, and
in the group he saw one that he recognized instantly
because of a certain jauntiness of bearing
and a cigar that was being chewed with a peculiar
fierceness from one side to the other in the man’s
generous mouth.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Mr. Conne—Mr. Conne!</i>” Skippy cried, wild
with delight. “It’s <i>me</i>—up here. Me and Nickie—Nickie
Fallon!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Carlton Conne pushed his derby hat almost off
his head and as he looked up his cigar went to the
side of his mouth and remained there at a right
angle.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Kid!” he shouted. “You there, eh? You all
right?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah!” Skippy was gasping. “But we can’t....”
He took hold of the bars one at a time and
shook them ferociously, with Nickie’s help, of
course, to prove what he was saying, “We can’t get
out through these ... these....”</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie shrieked! Something had happened.
“The bars, kid! Look, <i>they’re loose</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy looked in amazement. Miracles didn’t
happen of course. He remembered that they had
had to leave their task quite hurriedly the last time
they had been up there—it might have happened
that they had worked the bars loose enough to
wrench away, but in their haste had not discovered
it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nickie was straining himself to the very utmost
until he had worked them away sufficiently for them
to get their bodies through the window. Skippy
was feverishly engaged in swinging his lariat over
to the evergreen tree to the accompaniment of
joyous shouts.</p>

<p class='c008' >And then they were free of the house, sliding
hand over hand along the taut rope until they
reached the sturdy tree. Fallon got safely to the
ground first, and as Skippy followed he noticed
great curls of thick smoke pouring out from the
shutters on the lower floor.</p>

<p class='c008' >Somebody shouted, “We’ll get in at him the same
way the kids came out, hey, Conne—through the
attic?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t bother!” Mr. Conne was saying in his
brusque manner. “We’ll take no chances on losing
any lives. Let Dean Devlin roast. He deserves
it now—and hereafter too.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy was delighted that he was having his hand
shaken by the greatest detective in his country. It
was the longest handshake he had ever experienced.
And, what was more wonderful still, Carlton
Conne’s arm was about his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We only got your note last night, kid,” he was
saying. “Your sweet old lady didn’t get out her
pocketbook until yesterday afternoon when she
wanted to go out for a walk, after being laid up
with a cold. She took the train and came straight
to New York.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m sorry, Mr. Conne—I’m sorry....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What are you sorry for? You’ve been a clever
youngster through this whole thing—that note was
a masterpiece.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wrote it like that in case Devlin should find it
on me, then he wouldn’t know I was sort of workin’
for you,” Skippy said apologetically.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Couldn’t have done better myself!” Mr.
Conne said crisply.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We doped out the distance from the way you
figured the time and your idea of telling how the
house came to be left here and about the hermit.
We knew you were somewhere in this section because
Dick Hallam reported he spotted you in Hillbriar.
I learned only yesterday from an insurance
company complaint that an apparent systematic effort
was being made to defraud by insuring boys
and doing away with them to collect on the policies.
I got Hallam on the phone, had him check in Hillbriar
and he dug up the evidence that linked Devlin
unmistakably to the racket. And a few hours later,
just before I got your note, I received the information
that Devlin, who had been in an insane asylum,
when we thought he was under cover and had escaped,
had developed a mania for killing while
being apparently normal in other respects.”</p>

<p class='c008' >He patted Skippy on the back and then went on:
“So I prayed for a break that we might get to you
in time. I blamed myself for putting you in such
danger, but I never knew Devlin as a killer and I
never suspected the racket he was working, or I
wouldn’t have sent you on the job. Well, thank
God we made it in time.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s all right, it’s all right, Boss,” Skippy answered.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, it is—now,” Nickie agreed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Conne put the boys in his car and got in beside
them. “We’ll wait and see this thing go up
in smoke, eh? I always thought I didn’t have anything
cruel in me, but darned if I don’t enjoy knowing
that that smoke is taking Dean Devlin with it.
It’s almost too good for him—he should suffer for
making kids suffer.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah, poor Timmy,” Skippy sighed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, I’ve got in touch with his aunt in Glens
Falls. We traced him when you wrote his name
was Timmy Brogan. You haven’t any idea where
Devlin put him?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, an’ we don’t know where he put Frost last
night,” Skippy said, telling that part of their tragic
story. “I feel sorry about him too, Mr. Conne,
but it’s Timmy we’ll never forget. He mighta got
away if he hadn’t come back from the creek to
warn us about Devlin. He was like a hero, Timmy
was.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Conne thought so too, but was too much absorbed
to say very much. “I’m glad Fallon escaped
with you, kid,” he said, smiling at Nickie.
“Your aunt’s been worrying the police department
day and night to find out where you were.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah?” Nickie said abashed. “Holy smoke,
I’ll be glad seein’ her again.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Skippy grinned. “Nickie an’ me—gee whiz,
we’d gone crazy if we hadn’t been able to talk to
each other. That house....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Never mind, kid,” Mr. Conne said soothingly.
“It’s all over now, and I guess you’re good and
sick of this business, eh? It’s a rotten game and
your Aunt Min says she’ll never let you out of her
sight....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, listen, Mr. Conne,” Skippy interposed excitedly,
“I can talk Aunt Min into lettin’ me do
anything—I ain’t worryin’ about her. It’s you—will
you gimme that job you promised me? If you
say I did good....”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Conne tilted his cigar up in the corner of
his mouth and looked at Skippy quizzically. “Now
I might consider that job, kid,” he said, half smiling,
“if you’ll promise to keep that smudge off your
face when you come into my office. I notice it’s
dirty—and so early in the morning!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aw, that’s mud from yesterday—we put it on
for the mosquitoes! Anyway, will you do one thing
more, huh, Mr. Conne?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nickie’s promised to be awful good so will you
go his probation ’cause any judge would do that for
a feller if <i>you</i> went his probation—gee whiz!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I think the answer to that will be <i>yes</i>, kid. But
suppose we get away from here now, eh? It’s getting
a little too hot even for me. I haven’t had
my breakfast and I suppose you kids haven’t either.
We’ll stop at a nice lunch-wagon I noticed down on
the highway and we’ll have fried eggs and....”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee whiz, Mr. Conne!” Skippy interrupted.
“If you’re gonna say we’ll have bacon, please don’t
say it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No? Why not?” Carlton Conne had started
the car and was waiting, expectantly. “I thought
all kids loved bacon.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure, we did,” Skippy answered. “Nickie an’
me loved it like you say, but not now. Let’s go an’
eat, huh?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yeah,” Nickie said eagerly, “let’s scram.
Sometime we’ll tell about that bacon, Mr. Conne.”
Skippy nodded, took a long, last look at the
burning house and turned to Mr. Conne. “It’s a
sad story.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What is?” the detective asked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“The bacon,” Skippy answered simply.</p>
